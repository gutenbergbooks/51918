      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE planter
      alighted from the dusty-little train under the crumbling brick car-shed at
      Darley, and, turning his heavy hand-luggage over to the negro porter, he
      walked across the grass to the steps of the Johnston House. Here he was
      met by Jim Thornton, the dapper young clerk, who always had a curled
      mustache and oiled hair smoothed flatly down over his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, here you are, right side up, Captain Duncan!&rdquo; he cried, cordially.
      &ldquo;You can't stay away from those level acres of yours very long at a time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, Jim,&rdquo; the short, thick-set man smiled, as he took the extended hand;
      &ldquo;as soon as I heard spring had opened, I got a bad case of homesickness,
      and we left Florida. My wife and daughter came a week ago. I had to stop
      on business in Jacksonville. I always like to be here in planting season;
      my men never seem to know exactly what I want done when I am away. Jim,
      I've got a lot of fine land out there between the river and the
      mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you have,&rdquo; laughed the clerk, as he led his guest into the hotel
      office. &ldquo;There's a neighbor of yours over there at the stove, old Tom
      Mayhew, who runs the big store&mdash;Mayhew &amp; Floyd's&mdash;at
      Springtown.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know him mighty well,&rdquo; said Duncan. &ldquo;How are you, Mayhew? What are
      you doing away from your beat? I thought you'd be behind that counter such
      fine weather as this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trade's dull,&rdquo; said the merchant, who was a tall, spare-made man, about
      sixty-five years of age, with snow-white hair and beard. &ldquo;Farmers are all
      at the plough, and that's where they ought to be, Duncan, if they expect
      to pay anything on their debts this fall. I had to lay in some stock, and
      ran down to Atlanta day before yesterday. My young partner, Nelson Floyd,
      usually does the replenishing, but the books got out of whack and I left
      him to tussle with them; he's got a better head for figures than I have.
      I've just sent to the livery-stable for a horse and buggy to take me out;
      how are you going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I hardly know,&rdquo; answered the planter, as he took off his straw hat
      and wiped his bald head with a silk handkerchief. &ldquo;I telegraphed Lawson,
      my head overseer, to send somebody to meet me, and I was just wondering&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you'll be attended to all right, Captain Duncan,&rdquo; said the clerk,
      with a laugh, as he stood at the register behind the counter. &ldquo;Pole Baker
      was in here last night asking if you had arrived. He said he had brought a
      buggy and was going to drive you back. You will make it all right if Pole
      sobers up long enough to get out of town. He was thoroughly
      'how-come-you-so' last night. He was in Asque's bar raising holy Cane. The
      marshal ordered Billy to close at twelve, but Pole wouldn't hear to it,
      and they came in an inch of having a fight. I believe they would if Mrs.
      Johnston hadn't heard it and come down. Pole has more respect for women
      than most men, and as soon as he saw her at the door he hushed up and went
      to bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's as straight as a shingle this morning, captain,&rdquo; put in Charlie
      Smith, a mulatto porter, who was rolling a pair of trucks across the room
      laden with a drummer's enormous, brass-bound trunk. &ldquo;He was up before day
      asking if you got in durin' the night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad he's sobered up if he's to take me out,&rdquo; said the planter.
      &ldquo;He's about the biggest dare-devil out our way. You know him, don't you,
      Mayhew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know him? Humph! to the extent of over three hundred dollars. My partner
      thinks the sun rises and sets in him and never will close down on him.
      They are great friends. Floyd will fight for him at the drop of a hat. He
      says Pole has more manhood in him to the square inch than any man in the
      county, white or black. He saw him in a knock-down-and-drag-out row in the
      public square last election. They say Pole whipped three bigger men than
      he is all in a bunch, and bare-handed at that. Nobody knows to this day
      how it started. Nelson doesn't, but I heard it was some remark one of the
      fellows made about Nelson himself. You know my partner had a rather
      strange start in life&mdash;a poor boy with nobody to see to his
      bringing-up, but that's a subject that even his best friends don't mention
      to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The captain nodded understanding. &ldquo;They tell me Pole used to be a
      moonshiner,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and I have heard that he was the shrewdest one in
      the mountains. His wife got him to quit it. I understand he fairly
      worships the ground she walks on, and there never was a better father to
      his children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He thinks well enough of them when he's at himself,&rdquo; said Mayhew, &ldquo;but
      when he's drinking he neglects them awfully. I've known the neighbors to
      feed them two weeks on a stretch. He's got a few enemies out our way. When
      he quit moon-shining, he helped some of the government officers find some
      stills over there. That was funny! Pole held off from the job that was
      offered him for a month, during which time he sent word everywhere through
      the mountains that he would give all his old friends plenty of time to
      shut up and quit making whiskey, but after his month was up he would do
      all he could against any law-breakers. He had to testify against several
      who are now at large, and they certainly have it in for him. He'd have
      been shot long ago if his enemies wasn't afraid of him. But they will do
      him one of these days; you may mark my prediction. He is as cool and
      collected in time of danger as General Lee used to be. By gum, I saw him
      actually save the lives of twenty of the best citizens of this town about
      a year ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't mean it!&rdquo; exclaimed the planter. &ldquo;That's what he did, captain,&rdquo;
       Jim Thornton cried out from behind the counter. &ldquo;You bet your life that
      was a ticklish time. I wasn't here, but I heard of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, you wasn't on duty then,&rdquo; said Mayhew. &ldquo;I remember that, because Mrs.
      Johnston had to attend to the office herself. It happened, captain, that a
      squad of negro soldiers, commanded by a white officer, owing to some
      wash-out on the road this side of Chattanooga, had to lay over here all
      day, and they got about half drunk and started in to paint the town. They
      marched up and down Main Street, two abreast, looking in the stores and
      making fun of everybody and everything they saw. Finally hell got in them
      as big as house afire, and they come right in here, forty strong. The
      leader, a tall, black buck, over six feet high and weighing about two
      hundred, went up to Mrs. Johnston at the counter and said they wanted
      dinner. The old lady, feeble and gray-headed as she is, isn't a child. She
      knew exactly what it meant, and she was as white as a sheet, but she told
      the rascal quietly that her house did not entertain colored people.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'That's what I've heard,' the negro said, 'but we are going to eat here
      to-day or know the reason why.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good heavens!&rdquo; exclaimed Duncan, &ldquo;he ought to have been shot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; went on Mayhew, &ldquo;while she was trying to put him off, somebody ran
      for the white officer and told him to go order his men out, and he did
      start in this direction, but it was with a sneer and several questions
      about why his men couldn't eat in any hotel in America, and so forth, and
      when he got here in the office he just stood around and took no steps to
      stop the trouble at all. He sidled over to the cigar-case and stood there
      twisting his yellow mustache and turning his nose up, but he wouldn't give
      the command, and that made the negroes more unruly. Mrs. Johnston appealed
      to him, telling him it was his duty to clear her house of his drunken men,
      but he simply gave her no satisfaction. However, you can bet trouble was
      brewing. The news had spread like wildfire down the street, and every
      merchant and clerk that was any man at all shoved a pistol in his pocket
      and quietly slid into this room. They didn't seem to have any business
      here, and it was plain that the captain, who was a Northern man, had no
      idea he was so near an ambush; but a battle hung by a single hair. Both
      factions was armed, and one shot would have produced a hundred. The white
      citizens all had their lips set tight together, and not one had a thing to
      say to any other. They were all here for simple business, and each man was
      going to act on his own responsibility. The diningroom was open, and one
      or two drummers had gone in to dinner, and every white man's eye was on
      the door. They seemed to have made up their minds, one and all, that the
      first negro that made a break in that direction would never cross the
      threshold. I've been in war and carnage, but, by gum! that was the most
      ticklish situation I ever faced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just about that time I saw Pole Baker run in, panting and out of breath.
      He had been doing a job of whitewashing down at the wagon-yard and had on
      a pair of somebody's old overalls that wouldn't meet at the waist and
      struck him about the knees. He'd lost his hat in his hurry, and his long,
      bushy hair was all tangled. 'Have you got a spare gun?' he asked me, his
      lip shaking, his eyes bulging out. I told him I didn't have anything but a
      pocket-knife and might need that, and he plunged into the bar-room and
      tried to borrow a pistol from Billy Asque, but Billy was on the way out
      with his in his hip-pocket, and Pole come back frothing at the mouth and
      begun to look under that stove there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What you looking for?' said I. And he belched up an oath and said: 'Damn
      it, what you think I'm looking for&mdash;a feather bed? I'm looking for
      something to hit that black whelp with that's leaning over the register
      threatening that poor old lady.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he couldn't lay his hand on a thing, and it looked like he was about
      to cry. Then things got more serious. The negroes had bunched together,
      and we saw plainly that their plan was to make a break in a body for the
      dining-room. I saw Pole throw his big head back like our general used to
      do when things had reached a crisis.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'If something isn't done, and done quick,' I heard him say to himself,
      'some of the best citizens of this town will lose their lives, and all for
      a gang of drunken niggers. Something's got to be done, Mr. Mayhew,' he
      said to me.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Yes, but <i>what?</i>&mdash;that's the question,' said I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I saw him act. Without a single weapon in his hand, he stalked as
      straight as an arrow through the gang of negroes, elbowing them right and
      left, and went up to the captain and clamped his hand on his shoulder so
      heavy that I heard it clear across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Looky' here, you damned white coward!' he said, 'you order them coons
      out of here in five seconds or, by God, I'll knock every tooth in your
      head down your throat, and wedge 'em in with your gums. Quick, order, I
      say!'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The chap was about Pole's height, but he looked like a sapling beside a
      knotted oak, and he stared through his cigar smoke in astonishment. But
      Pole's left hand came down with a ringing slap on his shoulder-straps that
      almost brought the fellow to his knees, and Pole's big fist slid up close
      to his eyes, and then drew back for a sledge-hammer lick. The fellow
      blinked, and then with a growl and a sickly look about the mouth he gave
      the order. The negroes looked at him in astonishment, but Pole waved his
      big right hand and said, 'Get out! get out of here, and that mighty
      quick!' They moved slow, to be sure, but they went, the officer standing
      to one side looking plumb whipped. They had all gone down the steps, and
      the captain, mad and sullen, was about to follow, when suddenly Pole
      reached out and caught him by the collar and yanked him right back into
      the crowd that was surging forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Say, you've got to listen to a speech,' Pole said, still holding to his
      coat. 'I want to tell you that for a soldier you are the damnedest jackass
      that ever stood on its hind-legs in blue pants. You are a pretty excuse to
      send out even in charge of a set of ignorant coons. If it hadn't been for
      me calling a halt on this thing you'd 'a' had to haul your company to
      headquarters in a refrigerator-car, and you'd 'a' had that uniform changed
      to one of tar and feathers. Now, you go on, and when you strike another
      mountain town you will know what you are up against,' and with that Pole
      led the chap, who was pretty well scared by that time, to the steps and
      gave him a shove towards the train. Pole saved the day, and when that
      crowd of Darley men realized what a riot had been averted they gathered
      around him and began to praise him extravagantly. Billy Askew ran into his
      bar and came out with his old dog-eared ledger open at Pole's account, and
      he held it up and tore the page out. 'No man,' said he, 'can owe <i>me</i>
      for whiskey that's got that sort of a body to put it in, and Pole Baker
      from this day on is at liberty to stick his mouth to every bung-hole in my
      shop.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that night Pole was so drunk that the marshal started to lock him up,
      but the gang stood to him. They put him to bed up-stairs in the
      bridal-chamber, and sat around him till morning, singing battle-songs and
      raising the devil generally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see him coming now, Mr. Mayhew,&rdquo; said the clerk. &ldquo;Captain, he walks
      steady enough. I reckon he'll take you through safe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The tall countryman, about thirty-five years of age, without a coat, his
      coarse cotton shirt open at the neck, a slouched hat on his massive head
      and his tattered trousers stuffed into the tops of his high boots, came
      in. He wore a brown, sweeping mustache, and his eyebrows were unusually
      heavy. On the heel of his right boot he wore an old riding spur, very
      loosely strapped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Captain Duncan?&rdquo; he said to the planter, as he extended his
      brawny hand. &ldquo;You've come back to God's country, heigh?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Baker,&rdquo; the planter returned, with a genial smile. &ldquo;I had to see
      what sort of chance you fellows stand for a crop this year. I understand
      Lawson sent you over for me and my baggage. I'm certainly glad he engaged
      a man about whom I have heard such good reports.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know about <i>that</i>, captain,&rdquo; said Pole, his bushy
      brows meeting in a frown of displeasure, and his dark eyes flashing. &ldquo;I
      don't know as I'm runnin' a hack-line, or totin' trunks about fer the
      upper-ten set of humanity. I'm a farmer <i>myself</i>, in a sort of way&mdash;smaller'n
      you are, but a farmer. I was comin' this way yesterday, and was about to
      take my own hoss out of the field, where he had plenty to do, when Lawson
      said: 'Baker, bein' as you are goin' to make the trip <i>anyways</i>, I'd
      feel under obligations ef you'd take my rig and fetch Captain Duncan back
      when you come.' By gum, to tell you the truth, I've just come in to say to
      you, old hoss, that ef you are ready right now, we'll ride out together;
      ef not, I'll leave yore rig and go out with Nathan Porter. I say engaged!
      I'm not goin' to get any money out o' this job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I meant no offence at all, Baker,&rdquo; said the planter, in no little
      embarrassment, for the group was smiling.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon you didn't,&rdquo; said Pole, slightly mollified, &ldquo;but it's
      always a good idea fer two men to know exactly where they stand, and I'm
      here to say I don't take off my hat to no man on earth. The only man I'd
      bow down to died two thousand years ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the right spirit,&rdquo; Duncan said, admiringly. &ldquo;Now, I'm ready if you
      are, and it's time we were on the move. Those two valises are mine, and
      that big overcoat tied in a bundle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here, Charlie!&rdquo; Pole called out to the porter, &ldquo;put them things o'
      Duncan's in the back end o' the buggy an' I'll throw you a dime the next
      time I'm in town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, boss,&rdquo; the mulatto said, with a knowing wink and smile at
      Mayhew. &ldquo;They'll be in by the time you get there.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      While the planter was at the counter saying goodbye to the clerk, Pole
      looked down at Mayhew. &ldquo;When are <i>you</i> goin' out?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In an hour or so,&rdquo; answered the merchant, as he spat down into a
      cuspadore. &ldquo;I'm waiting now for a turnout, and I've got some business to
      attend to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Collections to make, I'll bet my hat,&rdquo; Pole laughed. &ldquo;I thought mighty
      few folks was out on Main Street jest now; they know you are abroad in the
      land, an' want to save the'r socks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you reckon that's it, Baker?&rdquo; said Mayhew, as he spat again. &ldquo;I
      thought maybe it was because they was afraid you'd git on the war-path,
      and wanted to keep their skins whole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The clerk and the planter laughed. &ldquo;He got you that time, Pole,&rdquo; the
      latter said, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll acknowledge the corn,&rdquo; and the mountaineer joined in the laugh
      good-naturedly. &ldquo;To look at the old skinflint, settin' half asleep all the
      time, a body wouldn't think his tongue had any life to it. But I've seen
      the dem thing wiggle before. It was when thar was a trade up, though.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S they were
      driving into the country road, just beyond the straggling houses in the
      outskirts of the town, going towards the mountains, which lay along the
      western horizon like blue clouds settling to earth, the planter said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've seen you fishing and hunting with Mayhew's young partner, Nelson
      Floyd. You and he are rather intimate, are you not?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jest about as friendly as two men can be,&rdquo; said Pole, &ldquo;when one's rising
      in the world an' t'other is eternally at a stand-still or goin' down like
      a round rock on the side of a mountain. Or maybe I ought to say, when one
      of 'em has had the pluck to educate hisse'f, an' t'other hardly knows B
      from a bull's foot. I don't know, captain, why Nelson Floyd's friendly to
      me. I like him beca'se he is a man from his toe-nails to the end o' the
      longest hair on his head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard a lot of good things about him,&rdquo; remarked the planter, &ldquo;and I
      understand, too, that he has his faults.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They're part of his manhood,&rdquo; said Pole, philosophically. &ldquo;Show me a
      feller without faults, and I'll show you one that's too weak to have 'em.
      Nelson's got some o' the dust o' the broad road on his coat, an' yet I'd
      take his place in the general stampede when old Gabe blows his trumpet at
      the millennium a sight quicker than I'd stand in the shoes o' some o'
      these jack-leg preachers. I tell you, Captain Duncan, ef the Lord's goin'
      to make favorites o' some o' the long-faced hypocrits I know, that is
      robbin' widows an' orphans in the week an' prayin' an' shoutin' on Sunday
      to pull the wool over folks' eyes, me an' Him won't gee in the hereafter.
      You know some'n about that boy's start in life, don't you, captain?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much, I must own,&rdquo; answered the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar it is,&rdquo; said Pole, with a condemning sneer; &ldquo;ef the pore boy had
      belonged to one o' the big families in yore ring out in Murray&mdash;the
      high an' mighty, that owned niggers, you'd 'a' heard all about him.
      Captain, nobody on earth knows how that feller has suffered. All his life
      he's wanted to make some'n of hisse'f, an' has absolutely, to my certain
      knowledge, had more to contend with than any man alive. He don't even know
      the exact date of his birth, an' ain't plumb-sure that his name really is
      Floyd. You see, jest at the close of the war a woman&mdash;so sick she
      could hardly walk&mdash;come through the Union lines in East-Tennessee
      with a baby in her arms. Accordin' to report, she claimed that her name
      was Floyd, an' called the baby 'Nelson.' She put up at a mountain cabin
      for the night, a shack whar some pore razor-back whites lived by name o'
      Perdue. Old man Perdue was a lyin', treacherous scamp, a bushwhacker and a
      mountain outlaw, an' his wife was a good mate to him. Nelson's mammy, as I
      say, was tuck in, but thar wasn't no doctor nigh, an' very little to eat,
      an' the next mornin' she was ravin' out of her head, and late that day she
      died. I'm tellin' you now all that Nelson Floyd ever was able to find out,
      as it come down to him from one person's recollection to another's. Well,
      the woman was buried somers, nobody knows whar, an' old Mrs. Perdue kept
      the baby more beca'se she was afeard to put it out o' the way than fer any
      pity fer it. She had a whole litter of brats of her own goin' about winter
      an' summer in the'r shirt-tails, an' so she left Nelson to scratch fer
      hisself. Then the authorities made it hot fer Perdue on some charges agin
      'im, and he left the child with another mountain family by name o' Scott
      and moved clean out of the country. The Scotts couldn't remember much more
      than hearsay about how Nelson got thar, an' they didn't care, though they
      tried to raise the boy along with three of their own. He had a tough time
      of it, for he was a plucky little devil, and had a fight with somebody
      mighty nigh every day. And as he growed up he naturally fell into bad
      company, or it fell into him like everything else did, an' he tuck to
      drinkin' an' finally become a regular young outlaw; he was a bloodthirsty
      rowdy before he was fifteen; shot at one man fer some cause or other an'
      barely escaped bein' put up fer life&mdash;nothin' but bein' so young got
      'im off. But one day&mdash;now I'm givin' it to you jest as Nelson told me&mdash;one
      day he said he got to thinkin' about the way he was a-goin', and all of
      his own accord he made up his mind to call a halt. He wanted to cut clean
      off from his old set, an' so he went to Mayhew, at Springtown, and told
      him he wanted to git work in the store. Old Mayhew would skin a flea fer
      its hide an' tallow, an', seein' his money in the boy, he bound 'im to an
      agreement to work fer his bare board an' clothes fer three years.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Low enough wages, certainly!&rdquo; exclaimed the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but Nelson didn't grumble, and Mayhew will tell you hisself that
      thar never was sech a worker sence the world was made. He was a general
      hand at ever'thing, and as bright as a new dollar and as quick as a
      steel-trap. The Lord only knows when or how he did it, fer nobody ever
      seed a book in his hands in business hours, but he l'arned to read and
      write and figure. An' that wasn't all. Old Mayhew was sech an old
      skinflint, and so hard on folks who got in his debt, that nobody traded at
      his shebang except them that couldn't go anywhars else; but lo and behold!
      Nelson made so many friends that they begun to flock around 'im from all
      directions, an' the business of the house was more than doubled. Mayhew
      knowed the cause of it, fer lots o' customers throwed it up to 'im. The
      prosperity was almost too much fer the old skunk; in fact, he got mighty
      nigh scared at it, and actually tried to dam the stream o' profit. To keep
      up sech a business, big credit had to be extended, and it was a new
      venture fer the cautious old scamp. But Nelson had perfect faith in all
      his friends, and thar it stood&mdash;a beardless boy holdin' forth that it
      was the old man's chance of a lifetime to git rich, and Mayhew half
      believin' it, crazy to act on Nelson's judgment, an' yet afraid it would
      be ruination. That was at the close of the boy's three-year contract. He
      was then about twenty year old, and I was in the store 'and heard the talk
      between 'em. We was all a-settin' at the big wood stove in the back end&mdash;me
      an' the old man, an' Nelson, and Joe Peters, a clerk, who is still there
      but was then workin' on trial. I shall never forget that night as long as
      I live. I gloried in Nelson's spunk to sech an extent I could 'a' throwed
      up my hat an' hollered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I've been waitin' to have a talk with you, Mr. Mayhew,' the boy said.
      'Our contract is out today, and you and me disagree so much about runnin'
      the business that I hardly know what I ought to do an' not stand in my own
      light. We've got to make a fresh contract, anyway.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I knowed that was comin',' old Mayhew said, with one o' his big, hoggish
      grunts. 'People for miles around have made it the'r particular business to
      fill you up with ideas about what you are wuth. I've thought some about
      lettin' you go an' see ef me an' Joe cayn't keep things a-movin'; but you
      know the trade round here, an' I want to do the fair thing. What do you
      think yore time's wuth?&rdquo; Pole laughed. &ldquo;The old skunk was usin' exactly
      the same words he'd 'a' used ef he'd been startin' in to buy a load o'
      produce an' wanted to kill expectation at the outset.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I. want fifty dollars a month, <i>under certain conditions''</i> the boy
      said, lookin' the old skinflint straight in the eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Fifty&mdash;huh! yo're crazy&mdash;stark, starin' crazy, plumb off yore
      base!' the old man said, his lip twisted up like it is when he's mad. 'I
      see myse'f payin' a beardless boy a Broadway salary to work in a shack
      like this out here in the mountains.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, I'll jest be obliged to quit you then,' Nelson said, as steady as
      a mill-pond on a hot day in August, 'an' I'd sorter hate to do it. Moore
      &amp; Trotter at Darley offer me that fer the fust six months, with an
      increase later.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Moore &amp; Trotter!' the old skunk grunted loud enough to be heard
      clean to the court-house across the street. They was the only firm in this
      end o' the state that controlled as much custom as Mayhew did, an' it
      struck the old chump under the ribs. He got up from his chair an' walked
      clean down to the front-door. It was shet an' locked; but thar was a lamp
      on the show-case nigh whar he stopped, an' I could see his old face
      a-workin' under the influence o' good an' evil. Purty soon he grunted, an'
      come back, thumpin' his old stick agin barrels an' boxes along the way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'How am I goin' to know whether Moore &amp; Trotter offered you that much
      or not?' he axed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Beca'se I said so,' Nelson told 'im, an' his dark eyes was flashin' like
      lightnin'. He stood up an' faced the old codger. 'I'll tell you one thing,
      Mr. Mayhew,' he let fly at 'im, 'ef you don't know whether I'm tellin' the
      truth or not you'd better not keep me, fer a man that will lie will steal.
      I say they offered me fifty dollars. I've got the'r written proposition in
      my pocket, but I'll be hanged ef I show it to you!'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good!&rdquo; exclaimed the planter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it knocked the old man clean off his feet,&rdquo; Pole went on. &ldquo;He sat
      down in his chair again, all of a tremble, an' white about the mouth.
      Stingy folks git scared to death at the very idea o' payin' out money,
      anyway, an' stingy don't fit that old cuss. Ef Noah Webster had knowed him
      he'd 'a' made another word fer that meanin'. I don't know but he'd simply
      'a' spelled out the old man's name an' 'a' been done with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What final answer did Mayhew give the young man, Baker?&rdquo; asked the
      planter, in a tone which indicated no little interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he jest set still fer a while,&rdquo; said Pole, &ldquo;an' me an' Joe Peters
      was a-wonderin' what he'd say. He never did anything sudden. Ef he ever
      gits to heaven he'll feel his way through the gate an' want to know ef
      thar's any other entrance. I seed 'im keep a woman standin' in the store
      once from breakfast to dinner time while he was lookin' fer a paper o'
      needles she'd called fer. Every now an' then he'd quit huntin' fer the
      needles an' go an' wait on some other customer, an' then come back to 'er.
      She was a timid sort o' thing, an' didn't seem to think she had the right
      to leave, bein' as she had started the search. Whenever she'd go towards
      the door to see ef her hoss was standin', he'd call 'er back an' ax 'er
      about 'er crap an' tell 'er not to be in a hurry, that Rome wasn't built
      in a day, an' the like. You know the old cuss has some education. Finally
      he found the needles an' tuck another half an' hour to select a scrap o'
      paper little enough to wrap 'em up in. But you axed me what Nelson said to
      'im. Huh! the boy was too good a trader to push a matter like that to a
      head. He'd throwed down the bars, an' he jest waited fer the old man to
      come into the grass of his own accord. Finally Mayhew axed, as indifferent
      as he could under all his excitement: 'When do you intend to answer the
      letter you say you got from Moore &amp; Trotter?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I expect to answer it to-night,' Nelson said. 'I shall tell 'em I
      appreciate the'r offer an' will run over an' see 'em day after
      to-morrow.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good! very well said, Baker,&rdquo; laughed Captain Duncan. &ldquo;No wonder the
      young man's got rich. You can't keep talent like that down. But what did
      old Mayhew say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was like pullin' eye-teeth,&rdquo; answered Pole. &ldquo;But he finally come
      across. 'Well,' said he, 'I reckon you kin make yorese'f as useful to me
      as you kin to them, an' ef you are bent on ridin' me to death, after I
      picked you up, an' give you a start, an' l'arnt you how to do business, I
      reckon I'll have to put up with it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I don't feel like I owe you anything,' said Nelson, as plucky as a
      banker demandin' good security on a loan. 'I've worked for you like a
      slave for three years for my bare livin' an' my experience, an' from now
      on I am goin' to work for number one. I said that I'd stay for fifty
      dollars a month <i>on certain conditions</i>.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Conditions?' the old man growled. 'What conditions do you mean?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why, it's jest this,' said Nelson. 'I've had my feelin's, an' the
      feelin's o' my friends, hurt time after time by you turnin' 'em away
      without credit, when I knowed they would meet the'r obligations. Now, ef I
      stay with you, it is with the distinct understandin' that I have the
      authority to give or refuse credit whenever I see fit.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That knocked the old man off his perch ag'in. He wilted an' sat thar as
      limp as a dish-rag. Joe Peters worships the ground Nelson walks on, an',
      as much as he fears the old man, he busted out in a big chuckle an' rubbed
      his hands together. Besides, he knowed Nelson was talkin' fer the interest
      o' the business. He'd seed no end o' good customers sent off fer no reason
      in the world than that Mayhew was scared o' his shadow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I'll never consent to <i>that</i>, anyway,' Mayhew said, mighty nigh
      clean whipped out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, Moore &amp; Trotter <i>will</i>,' Nelson said. 'That's one o' the
      things laid down in the'r proposition.' An' the boy went to the desk an'
      drawed out a sheet o' paper an' dipped his pen in the ink. The old man set
      quiverin' awhile, an' then got up an' went an' stood behind the boy. 'Put
      down yore pen,' said he, with a deep sigh from away down inside of 'im.
      'It would ruin me fer you to move to Darley&mdash;half the trade would
      follow you. Go ahead, I'll keep you, an' run the risk.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter had been listening attentively, and he now said, admiringly:
      &ldquo;Even at that early age the boy was showing the talent that developed
      later. It wasn't long after that, I believe, before he became the old
      man's partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The next year,&rdquo; answered Pole. &ldquo;He saved every dollar of his wages and
      made some good investments that turned out money. It wasn't a big slice of
      the business at fust, but he owns a half now, an', countin' his outside
      interests, he's wuth as much as old Mayhew. He's rich already, captain.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So I've heard the women say,&rdquo; smiled the planter. &ldquo;Women always keep
      track of well-to-do unmarried men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hain't 'spiled Nelson one bit, nuther,&rdquo; added Baker. &ldquo;He's the same
      unselfish friend to me as he ever was, and I hain't hardly got a roof to
      cover me an' mine. But as solid as he always was, he had a serious
      back-set about three years ago, and all his well-wishers thought it was
      goin' to do him up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean when he took to drinking,&rdquo; said Captain Duncan, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's what I mean. He'd formed the habit when he was a boy, and
      along with his prosperity an' late work-hours it begun to fasten its claws
      on 'im like it has on some other folks I know, captain. He had a lot o'
      night work to do, an' Thigpen's bar was right 'j'inin' the store. Nelson
      used to slide in at the back-door whenever the notion struck 'im; and he
      made the trail hot, I tell you. Old Mayhew kept a sharp eye on 'im, an'
      every now an' then he'd git powerful blue over the way things was a-goin'.
      Finally the old cuss got desperate an' called a halt. He had a straight
      talk with Nelson, an' told 'im they would have to divide the'r interests,
      that he wasn't a drinkin' man hisse'f, an' he didn't want to be yoked to a
      feller that was soaked half the time. It fetched the boy to his senses. He
      come over to my house that night an' called me out to the fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'I want to make a deal with you, Pole,' said he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'With me?' says I. 'What sort of a deal?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Why,' said he, 'I've made up my mind to swear off fer good an' all, an'
      I want you to jine me.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I agreed all right,&rdquo; Pole laughed. &ldquo;In fact, I was sorter in that
      business; I'd promised every preacher an' temperance worker in the county
      to quit, an' I couldn't refuse a friend what I was dispensin' so freely
      right an' left. So I said, said I: 'All right, Nelson, I'm with you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And how did it come out?&rdquo; questioned the planter, as he bowed to a
      wagonful of farmers going in an opposite direction.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;His vaccination tuck,&rdquo; Pole smiled. &ldquo;He had a mighty sore arm fer a week
      or so, but he helt out. As fer me, I was so dem glad to see his success in
      abstainin' that I started in to celebrate. I did try, though. One mornin'
      I went in the store an' seed Nelson have sech a clean, prosperous look an'
      so well satisfied with his stand that I went out with fresh resolutions.
      What did I do? I went to the bar-room an' bought four pint bottles o' red
      rye an' tuck 'em home with me. I set 'em all in a straight row on the
      mantel-shelf, nigh the edge, in front o' the clock, an' was standin'
      lookin' at 'em when Sally, my wife, come in. She seed the display, an'
      jest set kerflop down in her chair an' begun to whimper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'You hold on!' said I; 'don't you cross a foot-log till the tree's down.
      I'm tryin' a new dicker. I've always heard that &ldquo;familiarity breeds
      contempt,&rdquo; an' I've also heard that &ldquo;the hair o' the dog is good fer the
      bite.&rdquo; Now, I've tried my level best to quit liquor by stayin' away from
      it, an' I'm a-goin' to see ef I cayn't do it with its eye on me all the
      time.' Well, sir, the sweet little woman&mdash;she's a sweet, dear little
      creature, Captain Duncan, ef I do say it myse'f.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've always heard so, Baker,&rdquo; the planter said. &ldquo;She's very popular with
      your neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' I'm jest t'other way,&rdquo; said Pole. &ldquo;Well, Sally she got up an' kissed
      me, an' said that somehow she felt like my plan would work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And did it?&mdash;I mean&rdquo;&mdash;the captain recalled Pole's spree of only
      the night before&mdash;&ldquo;I mean, did it work for any length of time?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was goin' on to tell you,&rdquo; answered the mountaineer. &ldquo;That night fer
      the fust time sence my marriage I woke smack dab in the middle o' the
      night, an' as I laid thar in the room filled with moonlight I couldn't see
      a blessed thing but that row o' bottles, an' then my mouth set in to
      waterin' at sech a rate that I got afeard I'd ketch my death from sleepin'
      on a wet pillow. It was certainly a struggle with the flesh. I'd put my
      thirst, captain, when she's good an' dry, ag'in any that ever tickled a
      human throat. It ud take the blue ribbon at a convention o' drunkards.
      It's a rale thing; it kin walk, an' talk, an' kick, an' squirm, but it
      won't be dictated to. Finally Sally woke up an' said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'What's the matter, Pole? Hain't you comfortable?'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Comfortable the devil!' said I&mdash;I'm usually polite to Sally, but I
      felt like that wasn't no time an' place to talk about little matters.
      'Comfortable nothin',' said I. 'Sally, ef you don't take that &ldquo;doghair&rdquo;
       out o' this house an' hide it, I'll be as drunk as a b'iled owl in ten
      minutes.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Dog-hair?' said she, an' then the little woman remembered, an' she got
      up. I heard the bottles tinkle like sorrowful good-bye bells callin'
      wanderin' friends back to the fold as she tuck 'em up an' left. Captain, I
      felt jest like&rdquo;&mdash;Pole laughed good-naturedly&mdash;&ldquo;I felt like thar
      was a mean, stinkin' plot agin the best friends I ever had. I actually
      felt sorry fer them thar bottles, an' I got up an' stood at the window an'
      watched Sally as she tuck 'em away out in the lonely moonlight to the
      barn. I seed 'er climb over the fence o' the cow-lot an' go in at the side
      whar I kept my hay an' fodder an' roughness fer my cattle. Then I laid
      down in bed ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You acted right,&rdquo; said the planter; &ldquo;and you deserve credit for putting
      your foot down so firmly on what you felt was so injurious, even, even&rdquo;&mdash;the
      captain came back again to reality&mdash;&ldquo;even if you didn't remain firm
      very long afterwards.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell you one thing&mdash;&rdquo; The ex-moonshiner laughed again,
      and his eyes twinkled. &ldquo;It tuck Sally longer, it seemed to me, to git to
      sleep after she got back than it ever had in all her life. Of all times on
      earth, she wanted to talk. But I shet her off. I made like I was breathin'
      good an' deep, an' then she set in, too. What did I do? Captain Duncan, I
      spent the best half o' that night out in the barn lookin' fer hens' nests.
      I found two, an' had to be put to bed at sun-up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The planter laughed. &ldquo;There is one good thing about the situation, Baker,&rdquo;
       he said, &ldquo;and that is your making a joke of it. I believe you will get the
      under-hold of the thing some day and throw it over. Coming back to your
      friend Floyd, it's true he gave up whiskey, but if reports are reliable he
      has another fault that is quite as bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean all that talk about that girl,&rdquo; answered the mountaineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Baker, a reputation of that sort is not a desirable thing in any
      community. I know that many brainy and successful men hold that kind of
      thing lightly, but it will down anybody who tampers with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, look here, captain,&rdquo; Pole said, sharply; &ldquo;don't you be an old woman!
      'Ain't you got more sense 'an to swallow everything that passes among idle
      gossips in these mountains? Nelson Floyd has got a backbone full o' the
      fire o' youth an' is a hot-blooded young chap, but he's, to my positive
      knowledge, one o' the cleanest boys I ever come across. To tell you the
      truth, I don't believe he ever made but that one slip. It got out,
      unfortunately, an' beca'se he was rich an' prominent it raised a regular
      whirlwind o' talk an' exaggeration. If it had happened to half a dozen
      other young men round about here, not a word would 'a' been said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      '&ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; smiled the planter, &ldquo;he's not as black as he's painted,
      then.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a jugful,&rdquo; said the farmer. &ldquo;I tell you he's all right, an' folks
      will know it 'fore long.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">S</span>PRINGTOWN was
      about twelve miles west of Darley, only a mile from Captain Duncan's
      house, and half a mile from Pole Baker's humble cottage and small farm.
      The village had a population of about two hundred souls. It was the
      county-seat, and the court-house, a simple, ante-bellum brick structure,
      stood in the centre of the public square, around which were clustered the
      one-storied shops, lawyer's offices, cotton warehouses, hotel, and general
      stores.
    </p>
    <p>
      Chief among the last mentioned was the well-known establishment of Mayhew
      &amp; Floyd. It was a long, frame building, once white but now a murky
      gray, a tone which nothing but the brush of time and weather could have
      given it.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was only a week since Captain Duncan's talk with Pole Baker, and a
      bright, inspiring morning, well suited to the breaking of the soil and the
      planting of seed. The village was agog with the spirit of hope. The
      post-office was filled with men who had come for their mail, and they
      stood and chatted about the crops on the long veranda of the hotel and in
      the front part of Mayhew &amp; Floyd's store. Pole Baker was in the store
      talking with Joe Peters, the clerk, about seed potatoes, when a tall
      countryman, in the neighborhood of forty-five years of age, slouched in
      and leaned heavily against the counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want a box o' forty-four cartridges,&rdquo; he said, drawing out a long
      revolver and rapping on the counter with the butt of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What! you goin' squirrel huntin'?&rdquo; Peters laughed and winked at Pole.
      &ldquo;That gun's got a long enough barrel to send a ball to the top o' the
      highest tree in these mountains.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You slide around behind thar an' git me them cartridges!&rdquo; retorted the
      customer. &ldquo;Do yore talkin' to somebody else. I'll hunt what an' whar I
      want to, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, come off yore perch, Jeff Wade!&rdquo; the clerk said, with another easy
      laugh. &ldquo;You hain't nobody's daddy! But here you are. Forty cents a box,
      full count, every one warranted to make a hole an' a noise. Want me to
      charge 'em?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't; do you hear me?&mdash;I don't! An', what's more, I want to
      know exactly how much I owe this dern house. I've been to a dozen
      moneylenders 'fore I found what I wanted, but I got it, an' I want to pay
      what I owe Mayhew &amp; Floyd.&rdquo; Just then Pole Baker stepped up to the
      man's side, and, looking under the broad brim of his hat, he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Looky' here, Jeff Wade, what you shootin' off yore mouth fer? I 'lowed at
      fust that you was full, but you hain't drinkin', at least you don't seem
      to have no bottle on yore person.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Drinkin' hell! No, I'm not drinkin', an', what's more, I don't intend to
      let a drap pass down my throat till I've done my duty to me an' mine. Say,
      you look good an' see ef I'm drinkin'! See ef you think a man that's in
      liquor would have as steady a nerve as I've got. You watch me! Maybe it'll
      show you what I'm able to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, he stalked out of the store, and Peters and Pole followed,
      watching him in wonder. He strode across the street to the court-house,
      loading his revolver as he went. Reaching the closed door of the building,
      he took an envelope from his pocket and fastened it to the panel by
      thrusting the blade of his big pocket-knife into it several times. The
      spectators heard the hollow, resounding blows like the strokes of a
      carpenter's hammer, and then Wade turned and came back towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum, he's off his nut!&rdquo; said Peters, seriously. &ldquo;He's as crazy as a
      bed-bug.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's my opinion he's jest comin' to his senses,&rdquo; Pole mused, a troubled
      look in his eyes. &ldquo;Yes, that's about it; he's jest wakin' up, an' the
      whole county will know it, too. By gum, I hate this&mdash;I hate it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You hate what?&rdquo; asked Peters, his eyes on the farmer, who was now quite
      near them. Pole made no reply, for Wade was by his side on the brick walk
      beneath the wooden shed in front of the store, his revolver swinging at
      his side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You fellows keep yore eye on that envelope,&rdquo; said Wade, and he cocked his
      revolver.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, don't make a damn fool o' yorese'f,&rdquo; said Pole Baker, and he
      laid a remonstrating hand on the iron arm of the gaunt mountaineer. &ldquo;You
      know it's agin the ordinance. You know you'll git into trouble; you listen
      to the advice of a friend. Put up that gun an' go home!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm my own boss, damn it!&rdquo; snarled the man with the weapon.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' a dern fool, too,&rdquo; answered Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's my lookout.&rdquo; Wade glared over his shoulder into the store
      and raised his voice significantly. &ldquo;I want to show this damn town how
      easy it will be fer me to put three shots into the blackest heart that
      ever pumped human blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better mind what yo're about, Jeff Wade.&rdquo; Pole Baker was pale, his
      lips were tight, his eyes flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know what I'm about. I'm tryin' to draw a coward from his den. I'm not
      shore&mdash;I'm not dead shore, mind you&mdash;but I'm mighty nigh it. Ef
      the guilty stand an' hear what I'm a-sayin' an' don't take it up, they are
      wuss than hell-tainted. You watch that white mark.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The bystanders, several comprehending, stood rigid. Pole Baker stared.
      Wade raised his Revolver, aimed steadily at the mark, and fired three
      shots in quick succession.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar!&rdquo; said the marksman, with grim triumph; &ldquo;as bad as my sight is, I
      kin see 'em from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum, they are thar!&rdquo; exclaimed Peters, with a strange, inquiring look
      into Pole Baker's set face. &ldquo;They are thar, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet they are thar, an' some'll be in another spot 'fore long,&rdquo; said
      Wade. &ldquo;Now, Peters, you go in the house an' bring me my account. I've got
      the money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wonderingly, the clerk obeyed. Pole went into the store behind him, and,
      as Peters stood at the big ledger writing, Pole stepped up to Nelson
      Floyd, who sat near a window in the rear with a newspaper in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you hear all that, Nelson?&rdquo; the farmer asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did I? Of course I did. Wasn't it intended for&mdash;&rdquo; The young merchant
      glanced furtively at Peters and paused. His handsome, dark face was set as
      from tense, inward struggle.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a pause. Peters went towards the front, a written account drying
      in the air as he waved it to and fro.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was about to ask you if&mdash;&rdquo; the young merchant began, but Pole
      interrupted him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, listen!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was the sound of clinking coin on the counter below. The cast-iron
      bell on the cash-drawer rang harshly as the clerk put the money away.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar, I'm even with this dirty shebang!&rdquo; It was Jeff Wade's raised voice.
      &ldquo;An' I kin act when the proper time comes. Oh, you all know what I'm
      talkin' about! Nobody kin hide a thing in these mountains. But you'll
      understand it better, ef it ever comes into yore own families. I never had
      but one little sister&mdash;she was all the Lord ever allowed me to have.
      She was married not more'n a month ago an' went off to Texas with a man
      who believes in 'er an' swears he will make her a good husband an'
      protector. But no sooner was the pore little thing gone than all this talk
      set in. It was writ out to her, an' she writ back to me to stop it. She
      admitted it was true, but wouldn't lay the blame. Folks say they know, but
      they won't talk. They are afeard o' the influence o' money an' power, I
      reckon, but it will git out. I have my suspicions, but I'm not yet dead
      shore; but I will be, an' what I done fer that scrap o' paper I will do
      fer that man, ef God don't paralyze this right arm. Ef the black-hearted
      devil is within the sound o' my voice at this minute, an' stays still,
      he's not only the thief of woman's happiness, but he's wuss than a coward.
      He's a sneakin' son of&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson Floyd, his face rigid, sprang up and went into Joe Peters's little
      bedroom, which was cut off in one corner of the store, and, opening the
      top drawer of an old bureau, he took out a revolver. Turning, he met in
      the door-way the stalwart form of Pole Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Put down that gun, Nelson! put it down!&rdquo; Pole commanded. &ldquo;Jeff Wade's
      deliberately set this trap to draw you into it, an' the minute you walk
      down thar it will be a public acknowledgment, an' he'll kill you 'fore you
      kin bat an eye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No doubt,&rdquo; said Nelson Floyd, &ldquo;but the fellow has his rights. I could
      never draw a free breath if I let this pass. I owe it to the poor devil,
      Pole, and I'll pay. That has always been my rule. I'll pay. Stand aside!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll be damned ef I do.&rdquo; Pole stood his ground firmly. &ldquo;You must listen
      to reason. It's deliberate death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Get out of the way, Pole; don't make me mad,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;I'm going
      down. I'd expect him to pay me, and I shall him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop! You are a fool&mdash;you are a damned hotheaded simpleton, Nelson
      Floyd. Listen to me.&rdquo; Pole caught the revolver and held on to the barrel
      of it while the young merchant clutched the butt. &ldquo;Listen to me, I say.
      Are you goin' back on a helpless little woman? After you have had yore
      fun, an' the pore little trick gets married to a man who believes in her,
      an' goes away off an' is on a fair road to happiness, are you, I say,
      a-goin' to publicly advertise her shame, an', no doubt, bust up a
      contented home?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God, Pole!&rdquo; exclaimed Floyd, as he sank onto the edge of Peters's
      bed, &ldquo;do you think, if I give Wade satisfaction it will&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Will it? It will be in every paper from Maine to Californy. Meddlesome
      devils will mark the articles an' mail 'em to the gal's husband. A lot o'
      folks did the'r level best to bust up the match, anyway, by talkin' to him
      about you an' others.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson Floyd stared at the floor and slowly nodded his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm caught in a more degrading trap than the one Wade set for me,&rdquo; he
      declared, bitterly. &ldquo;My acts have branded me as a coward and left me
      without power to vindicate myself. That's one of the ways Providence has
      of punishing a poor devil. A man may have a good impulse, but can't act
      upon it owing to the restrictions laid on him by his very sins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole looked down into the store.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nevermind,&rdquo; he said, gloomily. &ldquo;Wade's gone.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd dropped the revolver into the drawer of the bureau, and went back to
      his desk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's only a question of time, Pole,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He suspects me now, but is
      not sure. It won't be long before the full story will reach him, and then
      we'll have to meet. As far as I am concerned, I'd rather have had it over
      with. I've swallowed a bitter pill this mornin', Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it wasn't a lead one.&rdquo; Baker's habitual sense of humor was rising
      to the surface. &ldquo;Most any sort o' physic's better'n cold metal shoved into
      the system through its own hole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a step in the store. Pole looked down again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's old Mayhew,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm powerful glad he was late this mornin',
      Nelson. The old codger would have seed through that talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he would have seen through it,&rdquo; answered Floyd, despondently, as he
      opened a big ledger and bent over it. Mayhew trudged towards them, his
      heavy cane knocking against the long dry-goods counter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have the law on that fellow,&rdquo; he growled, as he hung his stick on
      its accustomed nail behind the stove. &ldquo;No rampageous dare-devil like that
      can stand right in my front-door and shoot for mere amusement at the
      county court-house. This isn't a fort yet, and the war is over, thank the
      Lord.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole glanced at Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, he's jest a little hilarious this mornin', Mr. Mayhew,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;He
      must 'a' met a mountain whiskey wagon on his way to town. Anyways, you
      needn't complain; he come in here jest now an' paid off his account in
      full.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What? paid off&mdash;Is that so, Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd nodded, and then bent more closely over the ledger. &ldquo;Yes, he paid up
      to date.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's queer&mdash;or I am, one or the other; why, boys, I had that
      fellow on my dead-list. I didn't think he'd ever raise the money, and if
      he did I had no idea it would drift our way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd left the desk and reached for his hat. Pole was watching him
      closely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Post-office?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Pole joined him, and the two walked part of the way to the
      front-door and paused. Joe Peters was attending a man on the grocery side
      of the house, and a young woman, neatly dressed, with a pretty figure and
      graceful movement, stood waiting her turn.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; Pole exclaimed under his breath, &ldquo;that's my little neighbor,
      Cynthia Porter&mdash;the purtiest, neatest, an' best little trick that
      ever wore a bonnet. I needn't tell you that, though, you old scamp. You've
      already found it out. Go wait on 'er, Nelson. Don't keep 'er standin'
      thar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole sat down on a bag of coffee and his friend went to the girl.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning, Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, his hat in his hand. &ldquo;Peters seems
      busy. I don't know much about the stock, but if you'll tell me what you
      want I'll look for it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning, she stared at him, her big brown eyes under their long lashes
      wide open as if in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why&mdash;&rdquo; She seemed to be making a valiant effort at
      self-control, and then he noticed that her voice was quivering and that
      she was quite pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I really didn't want to buy anything,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Mother sent me to tell
      Mr. Peters that she couldn't possibly have the butter ready before
      to-morrow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, the butter,&rdquo; Floyd said, studying her face and manner in perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the girl went on, &ldquo;she promised to have ten pounds ready to send to
      Darley, but the calves got to the cows and spoiled everything; that threw
      her at least a day behind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that don't make a bit o' difference to us, Miss Cynthia!&rdquo; the clerk
      cried out from the scales, where he was weighing a parcel of sugar. &ldquo;Our
      wagon ain't goin' over till Saturday, nohow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she will certainly be glad,&rdquo; the girl returned in a tone of relief,
      and she moved towards the door. Floyd, still wondering, went with her to
      the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You look pale,&rdquo; he said, tentatively, &ldquo;and&mdash;and, well, the truth is,
      I have never seen you just this way, Cynthia. Have you been having further
      trouble at home? Is your mother still determined that we sha'n't have any
      more of our buggy rides?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It wasn't that&mdash;<i>to-day</i>,&rdquo; she said, her eyes raised to his in
      a glance that, somehow, went straight to his heart. &ldquo;I'll tell you,
      Nelson. As I came on, I had just reached Sim Tompkins's field, where he
      was planting com and burning stumps, when a negro&mdash;one of Captain
      Duncan's hands&mdash;passed on a mule. I didn't hear what he said, but
      when I came to Sim he had stopped ploughing and was leaning over the
      fence, saying, 'Awful, horrible,' and so on. I asked him what had
      happened, and he told me.&rdquo; The girl dropped her eyes, her words hung in
      her throat, and she put a slender, tapering, though firm and sun-browned,
      hand to her lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Go on,&rdquo; Floyd urged her. &ldquo;Tompkins said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He said&rdquo;&mdash;Cynthia swallowed&mdash;&ldquo;that you and Jeff Wade had had
      words in front of the store and that Wade had shot and <i>killed you</i>.
      I&mdash;I&mdash;didn't stop to inquire of any one&mdash;I thought it was
      true&mdash;and came on here. When I saw you just then absolutely unharmed,
      I&mdash;I&mdash;of course it surprised me&mdash;or, I mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How ridiculous!&rdquo; Floyd laughed mechanically. &ldquo;There is some mistake,
      Cynthia. People always get things crooked. That shows how little truth
      there is in reports. Wade came in here and paid his bill, and did not even
      speak to me, or I to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard the shots myself, away down the road,&rdquo; said the girl; &ldquo;and as
      I got near the store I saw a group of men in front of the door. They were
      pointing down at the sidewalk, and one of them said, 'Jeff stood right
      there and fired three times.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd laughed again, while her lynx eyes slowly probed his face. He
      pointed at the court-house door. &ldquo;Cynthia, do you see that envelope? Wade
      was shooting at it. I haven't been over to see yet, but they say he put
      three balls close together in its centre. We ought to incorporate this
      place into a town, so that a thing of this sort wouldn't be allowed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was it!&rdquo; Cynthia exclaimed, in a full breath of relief. &ldquo;I
      suppose you think I'm a goose to be so scared at nothing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His face clouded over, his eyes went down. A customer was going into the
      store, and he walked on to the street corner with her before replying.
      Then he said: &ldquo;I'm glad, though, Cynthia, that you felt badly, as I see
      you did, when you thought I was done for. Good-bye, I am going to beg you
      to let me see you again before long, even if your mother <i>does</i>
      object.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As they walked away out of his sight Pole Baker lowered his shaggy head to
      his brawny hands, his elbows resting on his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Demed fool!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;Right now, with his head in the very jaws o'
      death, he goes on talkin' sweet stuff to women. A purty face, a saft
      voice, an' a pair o' dreamy eyes would lead that man right into the fire
      o' hell itself. But that hain't the p'int. Pole Baker, he's yore friend,
      an' Jeff Wade is a-goin' to kill 'im jest as shore as preachin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Pole left the store he saw nothing of Floyd, but he noticed something
      else. He was passing Thigpen's bar, and through the open door-way he
      caught sight of a row of flasks and bottles behind the counter. A
      seductive, soothing odor greeted him; there was a merry clicking of
      billiard-balls in the rear, the thunderous thumping of cues on the floor,
      and joyous laughter. Pole hesitated and then plunged in. At any rate, he
      told himself, one drink would steady his nerves and show him some way
      perhaps to rescue his friend from his overhanging peril. Pole took his
      drink and sat down. Then a friend came in and gave him two or three more.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the beginning of another of Pole's prolonged sprees.

      IV
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span> was Sunday
      morning a week later. Springtown's principal church stood in the edge of
      the village on the red-clay road leading up the mountain-side, now in the
      delicate green dress of spring, touched here and there by fragrant
      splotches of pink honeysuckle and white, dark-eyed dog-wood blossoms. The
      building was a diminutive affair, with five shuttered windows on either
      side, a pulpit at one end, and a door at the other. A single aisle cut the
      rough benches into two parts, one side being occupied by the men, and the
      other by the women. The only exception to this rule was the bench
      reserved, as if by common consent, for Captain Duncan, who always sat with
      his family, as did any male guests who attended service with them.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Rev. Jason Hillhouse was the regular pastor. He was under thirty years
      of age, very tall, slight of build, and of nervous temperament. He wore
      the conventional black frock-coat, high-cut waistcoat, black necktie, and
      gray trousers. He was popular. He had applied himself closely to the
      duties of his calling and was considered a man of character and worth.
      While not a college graduate, he was yet sufficiently well-read in the
      Bible and religious literature to suit even the more progressive of
      mountain church-goers. He differed radically from many of the young
      preachers who were living imitations of that noted evangelist, the Rev.
      Tom P. Smith, &ldquo;the whirlwind preacher,&rdquo; in that he was conservative in the
      selection of topics for discourse and in his mild delivery.
    </p>
    <p>
      To-day he was at his best. Few in the congregation suspected it, but, if
      he distributed his glances evenly over the upturned faces, his thoughts
      were focussed on only one personality&mdash;that of modest Cynthia Porter,
      who, in a becoming gray gown, sat with her mother on the third bench from
      the front. Mrs. Porter, a woman of fifty-five years of age, was very
      plainly attired in a calico dress, to which she had added no ornament of
      any kind. She wore a gingham poke-bonnet, the hood of which hid her face
      even from the view of the minister. Her husband, old Nathan Porter, sat
      directly across the aisle from her. He was one of the roughest-looking men
      in the house. He had come without his coat, and wore no collar or
      neck-tie, and for comfort, as the day was warm, he had even thrown off the
      burden of his suspenders and they lay in careless loops about his hips. He
      had a broad expanse of baldness, to the edge of which hung a narrow fringe
      of white hair, and a healthful, pink complexion, and mild, blue eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the sermon was over and the doxology sung, the preacher stepped down
      into the congregation to take the numerous hands cordially extended to
      him. While he was thus engaged old Mayhew came from the &ldquo;amen corner,&rdquo; on
      the right, and nodded and smiled patronizingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You did pretty well to-day, young man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I like doctrinal talks.
      There's no getting around good, sound doctrine, Hillhouse. We'd have less
      lawlessness if we could keep our people filled plumb-full of sound
      doctrine. But you don't look like you've been eating enough, my boy. Come
      home with me and I'll give you a good dinner. I heard a fat hen squeal
      early this morning, as my cook, old Aunt Nancy, jerked her head off. It
      looks a pity to take life on a Sunday, but if that hen had been allowed to
      live she might have broken a commandment by hunting for worms on this day
      of rest. So the divine intention may be carried out, after all. Come on
      with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't, Brother Mayhew, not to-day, thank you.&rdquo; The young man flushed as
      his glance struggled on to the Porters, who were waiting near the door.
      &ldquo;The fact is, I've already accepted an invitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From somebody with a girl in the family, I'll bet,&rdquo; Mayhew laughed, as he
      playfully thrust the crooked end of his walking-stick against the
      preacher's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I knew why women are so dead-set on getting a preacher in the
      family. It may be because they know they will be provided for, after some
      fashion or other, by the church at large, in case of death or accident.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The preacher laughed as he moved on shaking hands and dispensing cheery
      words of welcome right and left. Presently the way was clear and he found
      himself near Cynthia and her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sorry to keep you standing here,&rdquo; he said, his color rising higher as he
      took the hand of the girl and shook it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it doesn't matter at all, Brother Hillhouse,&rdquo; the old woman assured
      him. &ldquo;I'll go on an' overtake Mr. Porter; you and Cynthia can stroll home
      by the shadiest way. You needn't walk fast; you'll get hot if you do.
      Cynthia, I won't need you before dinner. I've got everything ready, with
      nothing to do but lay back the cloth and push the plates into their
      places. I want Brother Hillhouse just to taste that pound-cake you made.
      I'm a good hand at desserts myself, Brother Hillhouse, but she can beat me
      any day in the week.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know Miss Cynthia can cook,&rdquo; said the minister. &ldquo;At the picnic at
      Cohutta Springs last week she took the prize on her fried chicken.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you all that mother fried that chicken,&rdquo; said the girl,
      indifferently. She had seen Nelson Floyd mounting his fine Kentucky horse
      among the trees across the street, and had deliberately turned her back
      towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I believe I <i>did</i> fix the chicken,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter admitted, &ldquo;but
      she made the custards and the cake and icing, besides the poor girl was
      having a lot of trouble with her dress. She washed and did up that muslin
      twice&mdash;the iron spoiled it the first time. I declare I'd have been
      out of heart, but she was cheerful all through it. There is Nathan now. He
      never will go home by himself; he is afraid I'll lag behind and he'll get
      a late dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you to-day, Brother Porter?&rdquo; Hillhouse asked as they came upon
      the old man, under the trees, a little way from the church.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm about as common,&rdquo; was the drawling answer. &ldquo;You may notice that I
      limp a little in my left leg. Ever since I had white-swellin' I've had
      trouble with that self-same leg. I wish you folks would jest stop an' take
      a peep at it. It looks to me like the blood's quit circulatin' in it. It
      went to sleep while you was a-talkin' this mornin'&mdash;now, I'll swear I
      didn't mean that as a reflection.&rdquo; He laughed dryly as he paused at a
      fallen tree and put his foot upon it and started to roll up the leg of his
      trousers, but his wife drew him on impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wonder what you'll do next!&rdquo; she said, reprovingly. &ldquo;This is no time
      and place for that. What would the Duncans think if they were to drive by
      while you were doing the like of that on a public road? Come on with me,
      and let's leave the young folks to themselves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Grumblingly Porter obeyed. His wife walked briskly and made him keep pace
      with her, and they were soon several yards ahead of the young couple.
      Hillhouse was silent for several minutes, and his smooth-shaven face was
      quite serious in expression.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid I'm going to bore you on that same old line, Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; he
      said, presently. &ldquo;Really, I can't well help it. This morning I fancied you
      listened attentively to what I was saying.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, I always do that,&rdquo; the girl returned, with an almost perceptible
      shudder of her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It helped me wonderfully, Miss Cynthia, and once a hope actually flashed
      through me so strong that I lost my place. You may have seen me turning
      the pages of the Bible. I was trying to think where I'd left off. The hope
      was this: that some day if I keep on begging you, and showing my deep
      respect and regard, you will not turn me away. Just for one minute this
      morning it seemed to me that you had actually consented, and&mdash;and the
      thought was too much for me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't say any more about it, Mr. Hillhouse,&rdquo; Cynthia pleaded, giving
      him a full look from her wonderful brown eyes. &ldquo;I have already said as
      much as I can on that subject.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've known many of the happiest marriages to finally result from
      nothing but the sheer persistence of the man concerned,&rdquo; the preacher went
      on, ardently, &ldquo;and when I think of <i>that</i> I <i>live</i>, Miss Cynthia&mdash;I
      live! And when I think of the chance of losing you it nearly drives me
      crazy. I can't help feeling that way. You are simply all I care for on
      earth. Do you remember when I first met you? It was at Hattie Mayfield's
      party just after I got this appointment; we sat on the porch alone and
      talked. I reckon it was merely your respect for my calling that made you
      so attentive, but I went home that night out of my head with admiration.
      Then I saw that Frank Miller was going with you everywhere, and that
      people thought you were engaged, and, as I did not admire his moral
      character, I was very miserable in secret. Then I saw that he stopped, and
      I got it from a reliable source that you had turned him down because you
      didn't want to marry such a man, and my hopes and admiration climbed still
      higher. You had proved that you were the kind of woman for a preacher's
      wife&mdash;the kind of woman I've always dreamed of having as my companion
      in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't love him, that was all,&rdquo; Cynthia said, quietly. &ldquo;It would not
      have been fair to him or myself to have received his constant attentions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But now I am down in the dregs again, Miss Cynthia.&rdquo; Hillhouse gave a
      sigh. It was almost a groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      She glanced at him once, and then lowered her eyes half fearfully to the
      ground. And, getting his breath rapidly, the preacher bent more closely
      over her shoulder, as if to catch some reply from her lips. She made none.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm in the dregs again&mdash;miserable, afraid, jealous! You know
      why, Miss Cynthia. You know that any lover would be concerned to see the
      girl upon whom he had based his every hope going often with Nelson Floyd,
      a man about whom people say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; the girl turned upon him suddenly and gazed into his eyes
      steadily. &ldquo;If you have anything to say against him, don't do it to me.
      He's my friend, and I will not listen to anything against those I like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to criticise him.&rdquo; Hillhouse bit his white, unsteady lip,
      as he pinched it between his thumb and index finger. &ldquo;A man's a fool that
      will try to win a woman by running down his rival. The way to run a man up
      in a woman's eye is to openly run him down. Men are strong enough to bear
      such things, but women don't think so. They shelter them like they do
      their babies. No, I wasn't going to run him down, but I am afraid of him.
      When you go out driving with him, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again Cynthia turned upon him and looked at him steadily, her eyes
      flashing. &ldquo;Don't go too far; you might regret it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;It is an
      insult to be spoken to as you are speaking to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't, don't! You misunderstand me,&rdquo; protested the bewildered lover.
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I am not afraid of&mdash;you understand, of course, I'm not
      afraid you will not be able to&mdash;to take care of yourself, but he has
      so many qualities that win and attract women that&mdash;Oh, I'm jealous,
      Miss Cynthia, that's the whole thing in a nutshell. He has the reputation
      of being a great favorite with all women, and now that he seems to admire
      you more than any of the rest&mdash;&rdquo; The girl raised her eyes from the
      ground; a touch of color rose to her cheeks. &ldquo;He doesn't admire me more
      than the others,&rdquo; she said, tentatively. &ldquo;You are mistaken, Mr.
      Hillhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He failed to note her rising color, the subtle eagerness oozing from her
      compact self-control.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not blind,&rdquo; he went on, blindly building up his rival's cause.
      &ldquo;He admires you extravagantly&mdash;he couldn't help it. You are
      beautiful, you have vivacity, womanly strength, and a thousand other
      qualities that are rare in this out-of-the-way place. Right here I want to
      tell you something. I know you will laugh, for you don't seem to care for
      such things, but you know Colonel Price is quite an expert on genealogical
      matters. He's made a great study of it, and his chief hobby is that many
      of these sturdy mountain people are the direct descendants of fine old
      English families from younger sons, you know, who settled first in
      Virginia and North Carolina, and then drifted into this part of Georgia.
      He didn't know of my admiration for you, but one day, at the meeting of
      the Confederate Veterans at Springtown, he saw you on the platform with
      the other ladies, and he said: 'I'll tell you, Hill-house, right there is
      a living proof of what I have always argued. That daughter of Nathan
      Porter has a face that is as patrician as any woman of English royal
      birth. I understand,' the colonel went on to say, 'that her mother was a
      Radcliffe, which is one of the best and most historic of the Virginia
      families, and Porter, as rough as he is, comes from good old English
      stock.' Do you wonder, Cynthia, that I agree with him? There really is
      good blood in you. Your grandmother is one of the most refined and gentle
      old ladies I have ever met anywhere, and I have been about a good deal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not sure that Colonel Price is right,&rdquo; the girl responded. &ldquo;I've
      heard something of that kind before. I think Colonel Price had an article
      in one of the Atlanta papers about it, with a list of old family names. My
      father knows little or nothing about his ancestry, but my grandmother has
      always said her forefathers were wealthy people. She remembers her
      grandmother as being a fine old lady who, poor as she was, tried to make
      her and the other children wear their bonnets and gloves in the sun to
      keep their complexions white. But I don't like to discuss that sort of
      thing, Mr. Hillhouse. It won't do in America. I think we are what we make
      <i>ourselves</i>, not what others have made of <i>themselves.</i> One is
      individuality, the other open imitation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young man laughed. &ldquo;That's all very fine,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;When it was your
      forefathers who made it possible for you to have the mental capacity for
      the very opinion you have just expressed. At any rate, there is a little
      comfort in your view, for if you were to pride yourself on Price's
      theories, as many a woman would, you might look higher than a poor
      preacher with such an untraceable name as mine. And you know, ordinary as
      it is, you have simply got to wear it sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must not mention that again,&rdquo; Cynthia said, firmly. &ldquo;I tell you, I am
      not good enough for a minister's wife. There is a streak of worldliness in
      me that I shall never overcome.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That cuts me like a knife,&rdquo; said Hillhouse. &ldquo;It hurts because it reminds
      me of something I once heard Pole Baker say in a group at the post-office.
      He said that women simply do not like what is known as a 'goody-goody'
      man. Sometimes as coarse a fellow as Pole hits the nail of truth on the
      head while a better-educated man would miss and mash his thumb. But if I
      am in the pulpit, I'm only human. It seemed to me the other day when I saw
      you and Nelson Floyd driving alone up the mountain that the very fires of
      hell itself raged inside of me. I always hold family prayer at home for
      the benefit of my mother and sister, but that night I cut it out, and lay
      on the bed rolling and tossing like a crazy man. He's handsome, Miss
      Cynthia, and he has a soft voice and a way of making all women sympathize
      with him&mdash;why they do it, I don't know. It's true he's had a most
      miserable childhood, but he is making money hand over hand now, and has
      everything in his favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's not a happy man, Mr. Hillhouse; any one who knows him can see that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I suppose he broods over the mystery that hangs over his origin,&rdquo;
       said the preacher. &ldquo;That's only natural for an ambitious man. I once knew
      a fellow who was a foundling, and he told me he never intended to get
      married on that account. He was morbidly sensitive about it, but it is
      different with Floyd. He <i>does</i> know his name, at least, and he will,
      no doubt, discover his relatives some day. But it hurts me to see you with
      him so much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he goes with other girls,&rdquo; Cynthia said, her lips set together
      tightly, her face averted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And perhaps you know, Miss Cynthia, that people talk about some of the
      girls he has been with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that,&rdquo; said the girl, looking at him with an absent glance. &ldquo;There
      is no use going over it. I hear nothing all day long at home except that&mdash;that&mdash;that!
      Oh, sometimes I wish I were dead!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, that hurts worse than anything I have heard you say,&rdquo; declared the
      minister, stroking his thin face with an unsteady hand. &ldquo;Why should a
      beautiful, pure, human flower like you be made unhappy because of contact
      with a&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, I tell you, stop!&rdquo; the girl stared at him with flashing eyes. &ldquo;I am
      not going to have you talk to me as if I were a child. I know him as well
      as you do. You constantly preach that a person ought to be forgiven of his
      sins, and yet you want to load some people down with theirs&mdash;that is,
      when it suits you. He has as good a right to&mdash;to&mdash;to reform as
      any one, and I myself have heard you say that the vilest sin often
      purifies and lifts one up. Don't get warped all to one side, Mr.
      Hillhouse. I shall not respect your views any more if you do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The minister was white in the face and trembling helplessly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are tying me hand and foot,&rdquo; he said, with a sigh. &ldquo;If I ever had a
      chance to gain my desires I am killing them, but God knows I can't help
      it. I am fighting for my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And behind another's back,&rdquo; added the girl, bravely. &ldquo;You've got to be
      fair to him. As for myself, I don't believe half the things that the
      busy-bodies have said about him. Let me tell you something.&rdquo; They had come
      to a little brook which they had to cross on brown, almost submerged
      stepping-stones, and she paused, turned to him and laid her small hand on
      his arm, and said, portentously: &ldquo;Nelson Floyd has been alone with me
      several times, and has never yet told me that he loved me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not going to say what is in my mind,&rdquo; Hill-house said, with a cold,
      significant, even triumphant sneer on his white lip, as he took her hand
      and helped her across the stream.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you won't?&rdquo; Cynthia gave him her eyes, almost pleadingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is, not unless you will let me be plain with you,&rdquo; Hillhouse
      answered, &ldquo;as plain as I'd be to my sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They walked on side by side in silence, now very near her father's house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may as well finish what you were going to say,&rdquo; the girl gave in,
      with a sigh of resignation not untinged with a curiosity which had
      devoured her precaution.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I was going to say that, if what I have gathered here and there is
      true, it is Nelson Floyd's favorite method to <i>look</i>, do you
      understand?&mdash;to <i>look</i>, not talk love to the girls he goes with.
      He has never, it seems, committed himself by a scratch of a pen or by word
      of mouth, and yet every silly woman he has paid attention to (before he
      began to go with you) has secretly sworn to herself that she was the world
      and all to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's face became grave. Her glance went down, and for a moment she
      seemed incapable of speech. Finally, however, her color rose, and she
      laughed defiantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here is a girl, Mr. Hillhouse, who will not be fooled that way, you
      may rely on that. So don't, worry about me. I'll take care of myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've no doubt you will,&rdquo; said the preacher, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you'll see that I can,&rdquo; Cynthia declared, with animation. &ldquo;There's
      mother on the porch. Good gracious! do change the subject. If she sets in
      on it, I'll not come to the table. Like you, she believes all she has
      heard against him. She likes you and hates the ground he walks on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps that, too, will be my damnation,&rdquo; Hill-house retorted. &ldquo;I know
      something about human nature. I may see the day that I'd be glad of a
      doubtful reputation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her reproachful glance at this remark as he opened the gate for
      her and followed her in. Porter sat on the porch in the shade reading a
      newspaper, and his wife stood in the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Run in and take off your things, Cynthia,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, with a
      welcoming smile. &ldquo;Brother Hillhouse can sit with your pa till we call
      dinner. I want you to help me a little bit. Your grandmother is lying
      down, and doesn't feel well enough to come to the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When the women had gone in, and the preacher had seated himself in a
      rough, hide-bottomed chair near his host, Porter, with a chuckle, reached
      down to the floor and picked up a short, smooth stick, to the end of which
      was attached a piece of leather about three inches wide and four inches
      long.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's an invention o' mine,&rdquo; Porter explained, proudly, as he tapped his
      knee with the leather. &ldquo;Brother Hillhouse, ef you was to offer me a new
      five-dollar note fer this thing, an' I couldn't git me another, I'd refuse
      p'int blank.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say,&rdquo; said Hillhouse, concentrating his attention to the
      article by strong effort; &ldquo;what is it for?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know any other name fer it than a 'fly-flap,'&rdquo; said Porter. &ldquo;I
      set here one day tryin' to read, an' the flies made sech a dead-set at my
      bald head that it mighty nigh driv' me crazy. I kept fightin' 'em with my
      paper an' knockin' my specks off an' losin' my place at sech a rate that I
      got to studyin' how to git out of the difficulty, fer thar was a long
      fly-spell ahead of us. Well, I invented this thing, an' I give you my word
      it's as good fun as goin' a-fishin'. I kin take it in my hand&mdash;this
      away&mdash;an' hold the paper, too, an' the minute one o' the devilish
      things lights on my scalp, I kin give a twist o' the wrist an' that fly's
      done fer. You see the leather is too flat an' saft to hurt <i>me</i>, an'
      I never seed a fly yit that was nimble enough to git out from under it.
      But my fun is mighty nigh over,&rdquo; Porter went on. &ldquo;Flies has got sense;
      they profit by experience the same as folks does; at any rate, they seem
      to know thar's a dead-fall set on my bald-spot, an' they've quit tryin' to
      lay the'r eggs in the root-holes o' my hair. Only now and then a newcomer
      is foolhardy and inclined to experiment. The old customers are as scared
      o' my head as they are of a spider-web.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly is a rare device,&rdquo; said Hillhouse. &ldquo;I don't know that I ever
      heard of one before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon not,&rdquo; the farmer returned, placidly. &ldquo;Somebody always has to
      lead out in matters of improvement. My wife an' daughter was dead-set agin
      me usin' it at fust. They never looked into the workin' of it close, an'
      thought I mashed my prey on my head, but thar never was a bigger mistake.
      The flap don't even puncture the skin, as tender as the'r hides are. I
      know it don't, beca'se they always fall flat o' the'r backs an' kick
      awhile before givin' up. I invented another thing that I value mighty nigh
      as high as I do this. I never have seed another one o' them in use,
      nuther. It's in my room in the bureau-drawer. It's a back-scratcher. It's
      got a long, white-oak handle, like this, an' a little, rake-shaped trick
      with hickory teeth at the end. Well, sir, you may not believe it, but I
      kin shove that thing down under my shirt an' hit a ticklin' spot before
      you kin bat yore eye, while I used to rub the bark off'n the trees, all
      about, in my effort to git bodily relief. You may 'a' seed me leave
      meetin' right in the middle o' some o' yore talks. Well, that's beca'se my
      wife an' Cynthia won't let me take it to church with me. They'd a thousand
      times ruther I'd go outside an' rub agin a tree like a razor-back shote
      than have me do a thing that the Prices an' Duncans hain't accustomed to.
      Sech folks are agin progress.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillhouse laughed obligingly, his mind on what Cynthia had said to him,
      and then Mrs. Porter came to the door and announced that dinner was
      served.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">P</span>OLE BAKER decided
      to give the young people of the neighborhood a &ldquo;corn-shucking.&rdquo; He had
      about fifty bushels of the grain which he said had been mellowing and
      sweetening in the husk all the winter, and, as the market-price had
      advanced from sixty to seventy-five cents, he decided to sell.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole's corn-shuckings were most enjoyable festivities. Mrs. Baker usually
      had some good refreshments and the young people came for miles around. The
      only drawback about the affairs was that Pole seldom had much corn to
      husk, and the fun was over too soon. The evening chosen for the present
      gathering was favored with clear moonlight and delightfully balmy weather,
      and when Nelson Floyd walked over after working an hour on his books at
      the store, he found a merry group in Pole's front-yard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yo're jest in time,&rdquo; Pole called out to him, as he threw the frail gate
      open for the guest to pass through. &ldquo;I was afeared thar was a few more
      petticoats than pants to string around my pile o' corn, an' you'll help
      even up. Come on, all of you, let's mosey on down to the barn. Sally,&rdquo; he
      called out to his wife, a sweet-faced woman on the porch, &ldquo;put them
      childern to sleep an' come on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With merry laughter the young men and girls made a rush in the direction
      of the barn. Nelson Floyd, with a sudden throbbing of the heart, had
      noticed Cynthia Porter in the group, and as he and Baker fell in behind he
      asked: &ldquo;Who came with Cynthia Porter, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nobody,&rdquo; said Baker. &ldquo;She come over jest 'fore dark by the short-cut
      through the meadow. I'll bet a hoss you are thinkin' o' galavantin' 'er
      back home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I came for,&rdquo; said Floyd, with a smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sorry, fer this once,&rdquo; said Pole; &ldquo;but I cayn't alter my plans
      fer friend or foe. I don't have but one shuckin' a year, an' on that
      occasion I'm a-goin' to be plumb fair to all that accept my invite. You
      may git what you want, but you'll have to stand yore chance with the
      balance. I'll announce my rules in a minute, an' then you'll understand
      what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had now reached the great cone of com heaped up at the door of the
      barn, and the merrymakers were dancing around it in the moonlight,
      clapping their hands and singing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Halt one minute!&rdquo; Pole called out peremptorily, and there was silence.
      &ldquo;Now,&rdquo; he continued, &ldquo;all of you set down on the straw an' listen to my
      new rules. I've been studyin' these out ever since my last shuckin', an'
      these will beat all. Now listen! Time is a great improver, an' we all
      don't have to-shuck corn jest like our granddaddies did. I want to make
      this thing interest you, fer that pile o' corn has to be shucked an'
      throwed into the barn 'fore you leave yore places.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't preach a sermon fust,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Baker, as she
      appeared suddenly. &ldquo;Boys an' gals that git together fer a good time don't
      want to listen to an old married man talk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But one married man likes to listen to <i>that woman</i> talk, folks,&rdquo;
       Pole broke in, &ldquo;fer her voice makes sweet music to his ear. That's a fact,
      gentlemen an' ladies; here's one individual that could set an' listen to
      that sweet woman's patient voice from dark to sun-up, an' then pray fer
      more dark, an' more talk. I hain't the right sort of a man to yoke to, but
      she is the right sort of a woman. They hain't all that way, though, boys,
      an' I'd advise you that are worthy of a good helpmate to think an' look
      before you plunge into matrimony. Matrimony is like a sheet of ice, which,
      until you bust it, may cover pure, runnin' water or a stagnant mud-hole.
      Before marriage a woman will say yes an' no, as meek as that entire bunch
      of females. Sugar wouldn't melt in 'er mouth, but when she hooks her fish
      she'll do her best to make a sucker out'n it ef it's a brook trout at the
      start. I mean a certain <i>kind</i> of a woman, now; but thank the Lord,
      He made the other sort, too, an' the other sort, boys, is what you ort to
      look fer. I heard a desperate old bach say once that he believed he'd
      stand a better chance o' gittin' a good female nature under a homely
      exterior than under a pretty one, an' he was on the rampage fer a snaggle
      tooth; but I don't know. A nature that's made jest by a face won't endure
      one way or another long. Thar's my little neighbor over thar, ef she don't
      combine both a purty face an' a sweet, patient nature I'm no judge.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Pole, Cynthia don't want you to single her out in public that
      away,&rdquo; protested Mrs. Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's simply bent on flattering more work out of me,&rdquo; responded Cynthia,
      quite adroitly, Floyd thought, as he noted her blushes in the moonlight.
      &ldquo;We are waiting for your rules, Mr. Baker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; spoke up Floyd, &ldquo;give us the rules, and let us go to work, and then
      you can talk all you want to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, here goes. Well, you are all settin' about the same distance
      from the pile, an' you've got an equal chance. Now, the fust man or woman
      who finds a red ear of corn must choose a partner to work with, an',
      furthermore, it shall be the duty o' the man to escort the girl home, an'
      in addition to that the winnin' man shall be entitled to kiss any girl in
      the crowd, an' she hereby pledges herself to submit graceful. It's a
      bang-up good rule, fer them that want to be kissed kin take a peep at the
      ear 'fore it's shucked, an' throw it to any man they like, an' them that
      don't kin hope fer escape by blind luck from sech an awful fate.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think, myself, that it would be an awful fate to be kissed by a man you
      didn't care for,&rdquo; laughed Mrs. Baker. &ldquo;Pole has made his rules to suit the
      men better than the women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The second rule is this,&rdquo; added Pole, with a smile, &ldquo;an' that is, that
      whoever finds a red ear, man or woman, I git to kiss my wife.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good, that's all right!&rdquo; exclaimed Floyd, and everybody laughed as they
      set to work. Pole sat down near Floyd, and filled and lighted his pipe. &ldquo;I
      used to think everything was fair in a game whar gals was concerned,&rdquo; he
      said in an undertone. &ldquo;I went to a shuckin' once whar they had these rules
      an' I got on to exactly what I see you are on to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? What do you mean?&rdquo; asked Floyd. &ldquo;Why, you sly old dog, you are not
      shuckin' more than one ear in every three you pick up. You are lookin' to
      see ef the silk is dark. You have found out that a red ear always has dark
      silk.&rdquo; Floyd laughed. &ldquo;Don't give me away, Pole. I learned that when old
      man Scott used to send me out on a frosty morning to feed the cattle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I won't say nothin',&rdquo; Pole promised. &ldquo;Ef money was at stake, it 'ud
      be different, but they say all's fair whar wine an' women is concerned.
      Besides, the sharper a man is the better he'll provide fer the wife he
      gits, an' a man ought to be allowed to profit by his own experience. You
      go ahead; ef you root a red ear out o' that pile, old hog, I'll count you
      in.&rdquo; Pole rose and went round the other side of the stack. There was a
      soft rustling sound as the husks were torn away and swept in rising
      billows behind the workers, and the steady thumping of the ears as they
      fell inside the barn.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was not a fair game he was playing, and yet Nelson Floyd cared little
      for that. Even as it was, it was growing monotonous. He had come there to
      see Cynthia, and Pole's new rule was not what he had counted on. There was
      a lull in the merriment and general rustle, and Floyd heard Hattie Mayhew
      say in a clear tone: &ldquo;I know why Cynthia is so quiet. It's because there
      wasn't somebody here to open with prayer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd was watching Cynthia's face, and he saw it cloud over for a moment.
      She made some forced reply which he could not hear. It was Kitty Welborn's
      voice that came to him on her merry laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, yes, Cynthia has us all beaten badly!&rdquo; said that little blonde. &ldquo;We
      worked our fingers to the bones fixing up his room. Cynthia didn't lay her
      hand to it, and yet he never looks at any one else while he is preaching,
      and as soon as the sermon is over he rushes for her. They say Mr. Porter
      thinks Mr. Hillhouse is watching him, and has quit going to sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact,&rdquo; said Fred Denslow, as he aimed a naked ear of corn at the
      barn-door and threw it. &ldquo;The boys say Hillhouse will even let 'em cuss
      before him, just so they will listen to what he says about Miss Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That isn't fair to Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; Nelson Floyd observed, suddenly. &ldquo;I'm
      afraid you are making it pretty hot for her on that side, so I'm going to
      invite her over here. You see I have found the first red ear of corn, and
      it's big enough to count double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a general shout and clapping of hands as Floyd held it up to
      view in the moonlight. He put it into the pocket of his coat, as he rose
      and moved round towards Cynthia. Bending down to her, he said: &ldquo;Come on,
      you've got to obey the rules of the game, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She allowed him to draw her to her feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now fer the fust act?&rdquo; Pole Baker cried out. &ldquo;I hain't a-goin' to have no
      bashful corn-shuckers. Ef you balk or kick over a trace, I'll leave you
      out next time, shore.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You didn't make a thoroughly fair rule, Pole,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;The days of
      woman slavery are past. I shall not take advantage of the situation, for I
      know Miss Cynthia is praying for mercy right now.&rdquo; Everybody laughed as
      Floyd led the girl round to his place and raked up a pile of shucks for
      her to sit on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there ought to have been another rule,&rdquo; laughed Fred Denslow, &ldquo;an'
      to the effect that if the winning man, through sickness, lack of backbone,
      or sudden death, was prevented from takin' the prize, somebody else ought
      to have had a chance. Here I've been workin' like a corn-field negro to
      win, and now see the feller Heaven has smiled on throwin' that sort of a
      flower away. Good gracious, what's the world comin' to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll have <i>mine</i>, anyway,&rdquo; Pole Baker was heard to say, and he
      took his little wife in his arms and kissed her tenderly.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EFRESHMENTS had
      been served, the last ear of com husked and thrown into the bam, and they
      had all risen to depart, when Hillhouse hurried down the path from the
      cottage. He was panting audibly, and had evidently been walking fast. He
      shook hands perfunctorily with Pole and his wife, and then turned to
      Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm just from your house,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I promised your mother to come
      over after you. I was afraid I'd be late. The distance round by the road
      is longer than I thought.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid you <i>are</i> too late,&rdquo; said Floyd, with a polite smile. &ldquo;I
      was lucky enough to find the first red ear of corn, and the reward was
      that I might take home any one I asked. I assure you I'll see that Miss
      Cynthia is well taken care of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! I&mdash;I see.&rdquo; The preacher seemed stunned by the disappointment. &ldquo;I
      didn't know; I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Floyd has won fast enough,&rdquo; said Pole. &ldquo;An' he's acted the part of
      the gentleman all through.&rdquo; Pole explained what Floyd had done in excusing
      Miss Cynthia from the principal forfeit he had won.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Hillhouse seemed unable to reply. The young people were moving towards
      the cottage, and he fell behind Floyd and his partner, walking along with
      the others and saying nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was a lonely, shaded road which Floyd and his companion traversed to
      reach her home.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My luck turned just in the nick of time,&rdquo; he said, exultantly. &ldquo;I went
      there, Cynthia, especially to talk with you, and I was mad enough to fight
      when I saw how Pole had arranged everything. Then, by good-fortune and
      cheating, I found that red ear; and, well, here we are. You have no idea
      how pretty you look, with your hair&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, don't begin that!&rdquo; Cynthia suddenly commanded, and she turned her
      eyes upon him steadily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop? Why do you say that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because you talk that way to all the girls, and I don't want to hear it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd laughed. &ldquo;I declare you are a strange little creature. You simply
      won't let me be nice to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sure I don't like you when you speak that way,&rdquo; the girl said,
      seriously. &ldquo;It sounds insincere&mdash;it makes me doubt you more than
      anything else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then some things about me <i>don't</i> make you doubt me,&rdquo; he said, with
      tentative eagerness.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was silent for a moment, then she nodded her head. &ldquo;I'll admit that
      some things I hear of you make me rather admire you, in a way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Please tell me what they are,&rdquo; he said, with a laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've heard, for one thing, of your being very good and kind to poor
      people&mdash;people who Mr. Mayhew would have turned out of their homes
      for debt if you hadn't interfered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that was only business, Cynthia,&rdquo; Floyd laughed. &ldquo;I simply can see
      farther than the old man can&mdash;that's all. He thought those customers
      never would be able to pay, but I knew they would some day, and, moreover,
      that they would come up with the back interest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; the girl said, firmly. &ldquo;Those things make me rather
      like you, while the others make&mdash;they make me&mdash;doubt.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doubt? Oh, you odd little woman!&rdquo; They had reached a spring which flowed
      from a great bed of rocks in the side of a rugged hill. He pointed to a
      flat stone quite near it. &ldquo;Do you remember, Cynthia, the first time I ever
      had a talk with you? It was while we were seated on this very rock.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She recalled it, but only nodded her head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was a year ago,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;You had on a pink dress and wore your
      hair like a little girl in a plait down your back. Cynthia, you were the
      prettiest creature I had ever seen. I could hardly talk to you for
      wondering over your dazzling beauty. You are even more beautiful now; you
      have ripened; you are the most graceful woman I ever saw, and your mouth!&mdash;Cynthia,
      I'll swear you have the most maddening mouth God ever made out of flesh,
      blood and&mdash;soul!&rdquo; He caught her hand impulsively and sat down on the
      stone, drawing her steadily towards him.
    </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated, looking back towards Baker's cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit down, little girl,&rdquo; he entreated, &ldquo;I'm tired. I've worked hard all
      day at the store, and that corn-shucking wasn't the best thing to taper
      off on.&rdquo; She hesitated an instant longer, and then allowed him to draw her
      down beside him. &ldquo;There, now,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is more like it.&rdquo; He still
      held her hand; it lay warm, pulsating and helpless in his strong, feverish
      grasp.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you know why I did not kiss you back there?&rdquo; he asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know why you didn't, but it was good of you,&rdquo; she answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it wasn't,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I won't take credit for what I don't
      deserve. I simply put it off, Cynthia&mdash;put it off. I knew we would be
      alone on our way home, and that you would not refuse me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I shall!&rdquo; she said, with a start. &ldquo;I'm not going to let you kiss me
      here in&mdash;in this way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then you'll not pay the forfeit you owe,&rdquo; he said, fondling her hand.
      &ldquo;I've always considered you fair in everything, and, Cynthia, you don't
      know how much I want to kiss you. No, you won't refuse me&mdash;you
      can't.&rdquo; His left arm was behind her, and it encircled her waist. She made
      an effort to draw herself erect, but he drew her closer to him. Her head
      sank upon his shoulder and lay there while he pressed his lips to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she sat up, and firmly pushed his arm down from her waist.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry I let you do it,&rdquo; she said, under her breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why, darling?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Because I've said a thousand times that I would not, but I have&mdash;I
      <i>have</i>, and I shall hate myself always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When you have made me the happiest fellow in the state?&rdquo; Floyd said,
      passionately. &ldquo;Don't go,&rdquo; he urged, for she had risen and drawn her hand
      from his and turned towards her home. He rose and stood beside her,
      suiting his step to hers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you remember the night we sat and talked in the grape-arbor behind
      your house?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Well, you never knew it, but I've been there three
      nights within the last month, hoping that I'd get to see you by some
      chance or other. I always work late on my accounts, and when I am through,
      and the weather is fine, I walk to your house, climb over the fence, slip
      through the orchard, and sit in that arbor, trying to imagine you are
      there with me. I often see a light in your room, and the last time I
      became so desperate that I actually whistled for you. This way&mdash;&rdquo; He
      put his thumb and little finger between his lips and made an imitation of
      a whippoorwill's call. &ldquo;You see, no one could tell that from the real
      thing. If you ever hear that sound again in the direction of the
      grape-arbor you'll know I need you, little girl, and you must not
      disappoint me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd never respond to it,&rdquo; Cynthia said, firmly. &ldquo;The idea of such a
      thing!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you know I can't go to your house often with your mother opposing my
      visits as she does, and when I'm there she never leaves us alone. No, I
      must have you to myself once in a while, little woman, and you must help
      me. Remember, if I call you, I'll want you badly.&rdquo; He whistled again, and
      the echo came back on the still air from a nearby hill-side. They were
      passing a log-cabin which stood a few yards from the road-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Budd Crow moved there to-day,&rdquo; Cynthia said, as if desirous of changing
      the subject. &ldquo;He rented twenty acres from my father. The 'White Caps'
      whipped him a week ago, for being lazy and not working for his family. His
      wife came over and told me all about it. She said it really had brought
      him to his senses, but that it had broken her heart. She cried while she
      was talking to me. Why does God afflict some women with men of that kind,
      and make others the wives of governors and presidents?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there you are beyond my philosophic depth, Cynthia. You mustn't
      bother your pretty head about those things. I sometimes rail against my
      fate for giving me the ambition of a king while I do not even know who&mdash;but
      I think you know what I mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I think I do,&rdquo; said the girl, sympathetically, &ldquo;and some day I
      believe all that will be cleared up. Some coarse natures wouldn't care a
      straw about it, but you <i>do</i> care, and it is the things we want and
      can't get that count.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It is strange,&rdquo; he said, thoughtfully, &ldquo;but of late I always think of my
      mother as having been young and beautiful. I think of her, too, as a
      well-bred, educated woman with well-to-do relatives. I think all those
      things without any proof even as to what her maiden name was or where she
      came from. Are you still unhappy at home, Cynthia?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nearly all the time,&rdquo; the girl sighed. &ldquo;As she grows older my mother gets
      more fault-finding and suspicious than ever. Then she has set her mind on
      my marrying Mr. Hillhouse. They seem to be working together to that end,
      and it is very tiresome to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad you don't love him,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;I don't think he could
      make any one of your nature happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stared into his eyes. They had reached the gate of the farm-house
      and he opened it for her. &ldquo;Now, good-night,&rdquo; he said, pressing her hand.
      &ldquo;Remember, if you ever hear a lonely whippoorwill calling, that he is
      longing for companionship.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She leaned over the gate, drawing it towards her till the iron latch
      clicked in its catch. With a shudder she recalled the hot kiss he had
      pressed upon her lips, and wondered what he might later think about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never meet you there at night,&rdquo; she said, firmly. &ldquo;My mother doesn't
      treat me right, but I shall not act that way when she is asleep. You may
      come to see me here now and then, but it will go no further than that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall sit alone in the arbor,&rdquo; he returned with a low laugh, &ldquo;and
      I hope your hard heart will keep you awake. I wouldn't treat a hound-dog
      that way, little girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I shall treat a strong man that way,&rdquo; she said, and she went into
      the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      She opened the front-door, which was never locked, and went into her room
      on the right of the little hall. The night was very still, and down the
      road she heard Floyd's whippoorwill call growing fainter and fainter as he
      strode away. She found a match and lighted the lamp on her bureau and
      looked at her reflection in the little oval-shaped mirror. Remembering his
      embrace, she shuddered and wiped her lips with her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'll despise me,&rdquo; she muttered. &ldquo;He'll think I am weak, like those other
      girls, but I am not. I <i>am not</i>. I'll show him that he can't, and
      yet&rdquo;&mdash;her head sank to her hands, which were folded on the top of the
      bureau&mdash;&ldquo;I couldn't help it. My God! I couldn't help it. I must have
      actually wanted him to&mdash;no, I didn't. I didn't; he held me. I had no
      idea his arm was behind me till he&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a soft step in the hall. The door of her room creaked like the
      low scream of a cat. A gaunt figure in white stood on the threshold. It
      was Mrs. Porter in her night-dress, her feet bare, her iron-gray hair
      hanging loose upon her shoulders.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't go to sleep, Cynthia,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;till I knew you were safe at
      home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm here all right, mother, so go back to bed and don't catch your
      death of cold.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old woman moved across the room to Cynthia's bed and sat down on it.
      &ldquo;I heard you coming down the road and went to the front window. I had sent
      Brother Hillhouse for you, but it was Nelson Floyd who brought you home.
      Didn't Brother Hillhouse get there before you left?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but I had already promised Mr. Floyd.&rdquo; The old woman met her
      daughter's glance steadily. &ldquo;I suppose all I'll do or say won't do a bit
      o' good. Cynthia, you know what I'm afraid of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl stood straight, her face set and firm, her great, dreamy eyes
      flashing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and that's the insult of it. Mother, you almost make me think you
      are judging my nature by your own, when you were at my age. I tell you you
      will drive me too far. A girl at a certain time of her life wants a
      mother's love and sympathy; she doesn't want threats, fears, and
      disgraceful suspicions.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter covered her face with her bony hands and groaned aloud.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are confessing,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that you are tied an' bound to him by the
      heart and that there isn't anything left for you but the crumbs he lets
      fall from his profligate table. You confess that you are lyin' at his
      feet, greedily lappin' up what he deigns to drop to you and the rest of
      those&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop!&rdquo; Cynthia sprang to her mother and laid her small hand heavily on
      the thin shoulder. &ldquo;Stop, you know you are telling a deliberate&mdash;&rdquo;
       She paused, turned, and went slowly back to the bureau. &ldquo;God forgive me!
      God help me remember my duty to her as my mother. She's old; she's out of
      her head.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There, you said something then!&rdquo; The old woman had drawn herself erect
      and sat staring at her daughter, her hands on her sharp knees. &ldquo;That
      reminds me of something else. You know my sister Martha got to worryin'
      when she was along about my age over her law-suit matters, and kept it up
      till her brain gave way. Folks always said she and I were alike. Dr.
      Strong has told me time after time to guard against worry or I'd go out
      and kill myself as she did. I haven't mentioned this before, but I do now.
      I can't keep down my fears and suspicions, while the very air is full of
      that man's conduct. He's a devil, I tell you&mdash;a devil in human shape.
      Your pretty face has caught his fancy, and your holding him off, so far,
      has made him determined to crush you like a plucked flower. Why don't he
      go to the Duncans and the Prices and lay his plans? Because those men
      shoot at the drop of a hat. He knows your pa is not of that stamp and that
      you haven't any men kin to defend our family honor. He hasn't any of his
      own; nobody knows who or what he is. My opinion is that he's a nobody and
      knows it, and out of pure spite is trying to pull everybody else down to
      his level.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&mdash;&rdquo; Cynthia's tone had softened. Her face was filling with
      sudden pity for the quivering creature on the bed. &ldquo;Mother, will you not
      have faith in me? If I promise you honestly to take care of myself, and
      make him understand what and who I am, won't that satisfy you? Even men
      with bad reputations have a good side to their natures, and they often
      reach a point at which they reform. A man like that interests a woman. I
      don't dispute that, but there are strong women and weak women. Mother, I'm
      not a weak woman; as God is my judge, I'm able to take care of myself. It
      pains me to say this, for you ought to know it; you ought to <i>feel</i>
      it. You ought to see it in my eye and hear it in my voice. Now go to bed,
      and sleep. I'm really afraid you may lose your mind since you told me
      about Aunt Martha.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the old woman changed. It lighted up with sudden hope.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow, I believe what you say,&rdquo; she said, with a faint smile. &ldquo;Anyway,
      I'll try not to worry any more.&rdquo; She rose and went to the door. &ldquo;Yes, I'll
      try not to worry any more,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;It may all come out right.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she found herself alone Cynthia turned and looked at her reflection
      in the glass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't once tell me plainly that he loved me,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He has never
      used that word. He has never said that he meant or wanted to mar&mdash;&rdquo;
       She broke off, staring into the depths of her own great, troubled eyes&mdash;&ldquo;and
      yet I let him hold me in his arms and kiss me&mdash;<i>me!</i>&rdquo; A hot
      flush filled her neck and face and spread to the roots of her hair. Then
      suddenly she blew out the light and crept to her bed.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">O</span>N the following
      Saturday morning there was, as usual, a considerable gathering of farmers
      at Springtown. A heavy fall of rain during the night had rendered the soil
      unfit for ploughing, and it was a sort of enforced holiday. Many of them
      stood around Mayhew &amp; Floyd's store. Several women and children were
      seated between the two long counters, on boxes and the few available
      chairs. Nelson Floyd was at the high desk in the rear, occupied with
      business letters, when Pole Baker came in at the back-door and stood near
      the writer, furtively scanning the long room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where's the old man?&rdquo; he asked, when Floyd looked up and saw him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not down yet. Dry up, Pole; I was making a calculation, and you knocked
      it hell west and crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon that kin wait. I've got a note fer you.&rdquo; Pole was taking
      it from his coat-pocket.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Cynthia?&rdquo; Floyd asked, eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not by a long shot,&rdquo; said Pole. &ldquo;I reckon maybe you'll wish it was.&rdquo; He
      threw the missive on the desk, and went on in quite a portentous tone. &ldquo;I
      come by Jeff Wade's house, Nelson, on my way back from the mill. He was
      inside with his wife and childern, an' as I was passin' one of the little
      boys run out to the fence and called me in to whar he was. He's a devil of
      a fellow! He's expectin' his wife to be confined, an' I saw he was try'in'
      to keep her in the dark. What you reckon he said?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How do I know?&rdquo; The young merchant, with a serious expression of face,
      had tom open the envelope, but had not yet unfolded the sheet of cheap,
      blue-lined writing-paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he jest set thar in his chair before the fire, an' as he handed the
      note up to me he sorter looked knowin' an' said, said he: 'Pole, I'm owin'
      Mayhew &amp; Floyd a little balance on my account, an' they seem uneasy. I
      wish you'd take this letter to young Floyd. He's always stood to me,
      sorter, an' I believe he'll git old Mayhew to wait on me a little while.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he say that, Pole?&rdquo; Floyd had opened the note, but was looking
      straight into Baker's eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he said them very words, Nelson, although he knowed I was on hand
      that day when he paid off his bill in full. I couldn't chip in thar before
      his wife, an' the Lord knows I couldn't tell him I had an idea what was in
      the note, so I rid on as fast as I could. I had a turn o' meal under me,
      an' I tuck it off an' hid it in the thicket t'other side o' Duncan's big
      spring. I wasn't goin' to carry a secret war-message a-straddle o' two
      bushels o' meal warm from the mill-rocks. An' I'd bet my hat that sheet o'
      paper hain't no flag o' truce.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd read the note. There was scarcely a change in the expression of his
      face or a flicker of his eyelashes as he folded it with steady fingers and
      held it in his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he says he has got the whole story, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;He gives me
      fair warning as a man of honor to arm myself. He will be here at twelve
      o'clock to the minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God!&rdquo; Pole ejaculated. &ldquo;You hain't one chance in a million to
      escape with yore life. You seed how he shot t'other day. He was excited
      then&mdash;he was as ca'm as a rock mountain when I seed him awhile ago,
      an' his ride to town will steady 'im more. He sorter drawed down his mouth
      at one corner an' cocked up his eye, same as to say, 'You understand; thar
      hain't no use in upsettin' women folks over a necessary matter o' this
      sort.' Looky' here, Nelson, old pard, some'n has got to be done, an' it's
      got to be done in a damn big hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It will have to be done at twelve 'clock, anyway,&rdquo; Floyd said, calmly, a
      grim smile almost rising to his face. &ldquo;That's the hour he's appointed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you are a-goin' to set here like a knot on a log
      an' 'low that keen-eyed mountain sharp-shooter to step up in that door an'
      pin you to that stool?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't mean that, exactly, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd smiled, coldly. &ldquo;A man ought
      not to insult even his antagonist that way. You see, that would be making
      the offended party liable for wilful, coldblooded murder before the law.
      No, I've got my gun here in the drawer, and we'll make a pretence at
      fighting a duel, even if he downs me in the first round.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a fool, that's what you are!&rdquo; Pole was angry, without knowing
      why. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me you are a-goin' to put yore life up like that
      to gratify a man o' Jeff Wade's stamp?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's got his rights, Pole, and I intend to respect them,&rdquo; Floyd responded
      with firmness. &ldquo;I've hurt his family pride, and I'd deserve to be kicked
      off the face of the earth if I turned tail and ran. He seems to think I
      may light out; I judge that by his setting the time a couple of hours
      ahead, but I'll give him satisfaction. I'm built that way, Pole. There is
      no use arguing about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer stepped forward and laid a heavy-hand on Floyd's shoulder, and
      stared at him from beneath his lowering brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You know, as well as I do, that you wasn't the only man that&mdash;that
      dabbled in that dirty business,&rdquo; he said, sharply, &ldquo;an' it's derned
      foolish fer you to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm the only one he's charging with it,&rdquo; broke in the merchant, &ldquo;and that
      settles it. I'm not an overgrown baby, Pole. Right now you are trying to
      get me to act in a way that would make you heartily ashamed of me. You
      might as well dry up. I'm not going to run. I'm going to meet Jeff Wade,
      fair and square, as a man&mdash;as I'd want him to meet me under like
      circumstances.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; Pole said under his breath. &ldquo;Hush! thar comes Mayhew. I
      reckon you don't want him to know about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he'd be in for swearing out a peace-warrant. For all you do, Pole,
      don't let him onto it. I've got to write a letter or two before Wade
      comes; don't let the old man interrupt me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll feel like I'm dancin' on yore scaffold,&rdquo; the farmer growled. &ldquo;I want
      my mind free to&mdash;to study. Thar! he's stopped to speak to Joe Peters.
      Say, Nelson, I see Mel Jones down thar talkin' to a squad in front o' the
      door; they've got the'r heads packed together as close as sardines. I see
      through it now. My Lord, I see through <i>that</i>.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it you see through, Pole?&rdquo; Floyd looked up from Wade's note, his
      brow furrowed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Mel's Jeff Wade's fust cousin; he's onto what's up, an' he's
      confidin' it to a few; it will be all over this town in five minutes, an'
      the women an' childem will hide out to keep from bein' hit. Thar they come
      in at the front now, an' they are around the old man like red ants over
      the body of a black one. He'll be onto it in a minute. Thar, see? What did
      I tell you? He's comin' this way. You can tell by the old duck's waddle
      that he is excited.&rdquo; Floyd muttered something that escaped Pole's ears,
      and began writing. Mayhew came on rapidly, tapping his heavy cane on the
      floor, his eyes glued on the placid profile of his young partner.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's this I hear?&rdquo; he panted. &ldquo;Has Jeff Wade sent you word that he is
      comin' here to shoot you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed out merrily, and, stepping forward, he slapped the old
      merchant familiarly on the arm. &ldquo;It's a joke, Mr. Mayhew,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I put
      it up on Mel Jones as me'n him rid in town; he's always makin' fun o'
      women fer tattlin', an' said I to myse'f, said I, 'I'll see how deep
      that's rooted under yore hide, old chap,' an' so I made that up out o'
      whole cloth. I was jest tellin' Nelson, here, that I'd bet a hoss to a
      ginger-cake that Mel 'ud not be able to keep it, an' he hain't. Nelson, by
      George, the triflin' skunk let it out inside o' ten minutes, although he
      swore to me he'd keep his mouth shet. I'll make 'im set up the drinks on
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't like such jokes,&rdquo; Mayhew fumed. &ldquo;Jokes like that and what's
      at the bottom of them don't do a reputable house any good. And I don't
      want any more of them. Do you understand, sir?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I won't do it ag'in,&rdquo; answered Pole, in an almost absent-minded
      tone. His eyes were now on Floyd, and, despite his assumed lightness of
      manner, the real condition of things was bearing heavily on him. Just then
      a rough-looking farmer, in a suit of home-made jeans, straw hat, and shoes
      worn through at the bottom, came back to them. He held in his hand the
      point of a plough, and looked nervously about him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Everybody's busy down in front,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an' I want to git a quarter's
      wuth o' coffee.&rdquo; His glance, full of curiosity, was on Floyd's face. &ldquo;I
      want to stay till Wade comes, <i>myself</i>, but my old woman's almost got
      a spasm. She says she seed, enough bloodshed an' carnage durin' the war to
      do her, an' then she always liked Mr. Floyd. She says she'd mighty nigh as
      soon see an own brother laid out as him. Mr. Floyd sorter done us a favor
      two year back when he stood fer us on our corn crop, an', as fer me, why,
      of course, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Bill Champ,&rdquo; Pole burst out in a spontaneous laugh, &ldquo;I thought
      you had more sense than to swallow a joke like that. Go tell yore old
      woman that I started that tale jest fer pure fun. Nelson here an' Wade is
      good friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, ef that's it, I'm sold,&rdquo; the farmer said, sheepishly. &ldquo;But from
      the way Mel Jones an' some more talked down thar a body would think you
      fellers was back here takin' Mr. Floyd's measure fer his box. I'll go
      quiet my wife. She couldn't talk of a thing all the way here this mornin'
      but a new dress she was goin' to git, an' now she's fer hurryin' back
      without even pickin' out the cloth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't like this sort o' thing,&rdquo; old Mayhew growled as the customer
      moved away. &ldquo;An' I want you to remember that, Baker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you dry up, old man!&rdquo; Pole retorted, with sudden impatience. &ldquo;You'd
      live longer an' enjoy life better ef you'd joke more. Ef the marrow o' my
      bones was as sour as yore'n is I'd cut my throat or go into the vinegar
      business.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      At this juncture Captain Duncan came in the store and walked back to the
      trio.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-morning,&rdquo; he said, cheerily. &ldquo;Say, Floyd, I've heard the news, and
      thought if you wanted to borrow a pair of real good, old-fashioned
      duelling pistols, why, I've got some my father owned. They were once used
      by General&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all a joke, captain,&rdquo; Pole broke in, winking at the planter, and
      casting a look of warning at the now unobservant Mayhew.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is <i>that</i> it?&rdquo; Duncan was quick of perception.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To tell you the truth, I thought so, boys. Yes, yes&mdash;&rdquo; He was
      studying Floyd's calm face admiringly. &ldquo;Yes, it sounded to me like a prank
      somebody was playing. Well, I thought I'd go fishing this evening, and
      came in to get some hooks and lines. Fine weather, isn't it? but the
      river's muddy. I'll go down and pick out some tackle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He had just gone when an old woman, wearing a cheap breakfast shawl over
      her gray head, a dress of dingy solid-black calico, and a pair of old,
      heavy shoes, approached from the door in the rear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got yore summons, Mr. Mayhew,&rdquo; she said, in a thin, shaky voice.
      &ldquo;Peter, my husband, was so down-hearted that he wouldn't come to town, an'
      so I had to do it. So you are goin' to foreclose on us? The mule an' cow
      is all on earth we've got to make the crop on, and when they are gone we
      will be plumb ruined.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The face of the old merchant was like carved stone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You got the goods, didn't you, Mrs. Stark?&rdquo; he asked, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, we hain't disputin' the account,&rdquo; she answered, plaintively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And you agreed faithfully if you didn't pay this spring that the mule and
      cow would be our property?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, of course. As I say, Mr. Mayhew, I'm not blamin' you-uns. Thar
      hain't a thing for me an' Peter to do but thrust ourselves on my daughter
      and son-in-law over in Fannin', but I'd rather die than go. We won't be
      welcome; they are loaded down with childern too young to work. So it's
      settled, Mr. Mayhew&mdash;I mean, ef we drive over the mule an' cow, thar
      won't be no lawsuit?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, there won't be any suit. I'd let this pass and give you more time,
      Mrs. Stark, but a thing like that can't be kept quiet through the country,
      an' there are fifty customers of ours over your way who'd be runnin' here
      with some cock-and-bull story, and we'd be left high and dry, with goods
      to pay for in market and nothing to show for it. We make our rules, Mrs.
      Stark, and they are clearly understood at the time the papers are signed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never you mind, Mrs. Stark, I'll fix that all right.&rdquo; It was Nelson Floyd
      who was speaking, and with a face full of pity and tenderness he had
      stepped forward and was offering to shake hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      The little woman, her lips twitching and drawn, gave him her hand, her
      eyes wide open in groping wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand, Nelson&mdash;Mr. Floyd&mdash;you mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that I'll have your entire account charged to me and you can take
      your time about paying it&mdash;next fall, or the next, or any time it
      suits you. I'll not press you fer it, if you never pay it. I passed your
      place the other day and your crop looks very promising. You are sure to
      get out of debt this coming fall.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nelson&mdash;I&mdash;I don't know what to do about it. You see Mr.
      Mayhew says&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I say it's all right,&rdquo; Floyd broke in, as he laid his hand softly on
      her shoulder. &ldquo;Go down in front and buy what you need to run on. I'll
      assume the risk, if there is any.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayhew turned suddenly; his face wore a fierce frown and his thick lip
      shook.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to say, Nelson, that you are going to step in and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Step in nothing!&rdquo; Floyd said, calmly. &ldquo;I hope I won't have to remind you,
      sir, of our clearly written agreement of partnership, in which it is
      plainly stated that I may use my judgment in regard to customers whenever
      I wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll ruin us&mdash;you'll break us all to smash, if you do this sort of
      thing,&rdquo; Mayhew panted. &ldquo;It will upset our whole system.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't agree with you, sir,&rdquo; Floyd answered, tartly, &ldquo;but we won't argue
      about it. If you don't intend to abide by our agreement, then say so and
      we will part company.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayhew stared in alarm for a moment, then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's no use talking about parting. I only want to kind of hold you in
      check. You get your sympathies stirred up and make plunges sometimes when
      you ought to act with a clear, impartial head. You say the crop looks
      well; then it's all right. Go ahead, Mrs. Stark. Anything Nelson does is
      agreeable to me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it's mighty good of you both,&rdquo; the old woman said, wiping tears of
      joy from her eyes. &ldquo;But I won't buy anything to-day. I'll ride out to the
      farm as quick as I can and tell Peter the good news. He's mighty nigh out
      of his senses about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mayhew followed her down into the store. It was as if he were ashamed to
      meet the quizzical look which Pole Baker had fixed upon him. He had no
      sooner turned his back than Pole faced Floyd, his heavy brows drawn
      together, his every feature working under stress of deep emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They say the Almighty is a just and a good God,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;But I'll
      deny it all the rest o' my life ef He lets Jeff Wade shoot down sech a
      specimen o' manhood as you are fer jest that one slip, after&mdash;after,
      I say, after fillin' you with the fire of youth an' puttin' right in yore
      track a gal like that Minnie Wade, with a pair o' dare-devil eyes an' a
      shape that ud make a Presbyterian preacher&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Dry up, Pole!&rdquo; Floyd cried, suddenly. &ldquo;Don't forget yourself in your
      worry about me. A man is always more to blame than a woman, and it's only
      the cowards that shirk the consequences.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have it yore way, an' I'll have it mine,&rdquo; Pole snorted. &ldquo;What
      both of us think hain't got a damn thing to do with the time o' day. How
      does she stand by your ticker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd looked at his watch. &ldquo;It's a quarter-past eleven,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The hell it is!&rdquo; Pole went to the back-door and looked out at the dreary
      stable-yard and barn. He stood there for several minutes in deep thought,
      then he seemed to make up his mind on something that was troubling him,
      for he suddenly thrust his hand into his hip-pocket, turned his back on
      Floyd, drew out a revolver, and rapidly twirled the cylinder with his
      heavy thumb.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I 'lowed I'd swore off from shootin'-scrapes,&rdquo; he mused; &ldquo;but I
      shore have to git in this un. I'd never look Sally an' the childern in the
      face ag'in ef I was to stand still an' let that dead-shot kill the best
      friend me an' them ever had. No, Poley, old boy, you've got to enlist this
      mornin', an' thar hain't no two ways about it. I'd take a drink on it, but
      a feller's aim ain't wuth a dang when he sees double.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His attention was suddenly attracted to Floyd, who had left his stool and
      was putting a revolver into the pocket of his sack-coat. Pole shoved his
      own cautiously back into his pocket and went to his friend's side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you goin' to do now?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I have just thought of something that ought to be attended to,&rdquo; was the
      young merchant's answer. &ldquo;Is Mel Jones still down there?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see 'im now through the left-hand window,&rdquo; said Pole. &ldquo;Do you want
      to speak to 'im?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes.&rdquo; Floyd moved in the direction indicated, and Pole wonderingly
      followed. Outside on the pavement, at the corner of the store, Jones stood
      talking to a group of eager listeners. He stopped when he saw Floyd and
      looked in the opposite direction, but in a calm voice the young merchant
      called him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mel, may I see you a minute?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Certainly.&rdquo; The face of the gaunt farmer fell as he came forward, his
      eyes shifting uneasily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got a message from Jeff Wade just now,&rdquo; said Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did you?&mdash;is that so?&rdquo; the fellow exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he says he has a private matter to settle with me, and says he'll be
      here at the store at twelve. Now, as you see, Mel, there are a good many
      people standing around&mdash;women and children&mdash;and somebody might
      get hurt or frightened. You know where Price's spring is, down behind the
      old brick-yard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I know where it is, Floyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you will do me a favor if you will ride out to Wade's and tell him
      I'll meet him there. He could reach it without coming through town, and
      we'd escape a lot of prying people who would only be in the way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a good idea,&rdquo; said Jones, his strong face lighting up. &ldquo;Yes, I'll
      go tell 'im. I'm glad to see that you are a man o' backbone, Floyd. Some
      'lowed that you'd throw up the sponge an' leave fer parts unknown, but
      Jeff's got to tackle the rale stuff. I kin see that, Floyd. Minnie's
      raised a lots o' devilment, an' my wife says she don't blame you one bit,
      but Jeff cayn't be expected to see it through a woman's eyes. I wish you
      was goin' to meet a man that wasn't sech a dead-shot. I seed Jeff knock a
      squirrel out of a high tree with his six-shooter that three men had missed
      with rifles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll try to take care of myself, Mel. But you'd better hurry up and get
      to him before he starts to town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'll git 'im all right,&rdquo; said the farmer, and he went out to the
      hitching-rack, mounted his horse, and galloped away.
    </p>
    <p>
      The group Jones had been talking to now drew near.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's all off, boys!&rdquo; Pole said, with one of his inscrutable laughs.
      &ldquo;Explanations an' apologies has been exchanged&mdash;no gore to-day. Big
      mistake, anyway, all round. Big, big blunder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      This version soon spread, and a sigh of relief went up from all sides.
      Fifteen minutes passed. Pole was standing in the front-door of the store,
      cautiously watching Floyd, who had gone back to his desk to write a
      letter. Suddenly the farmer missed him from his place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's tryin' to give me the slip,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;He's gone out at the
      back-door and has made fer the spring. Well, he kin <i>think</i> he's
      throwed old Pole off, but he hain't by a jugful. I know now which road
      Jeff Wade will come by, an' I'll see 'im fust ur no prayers hain't
      answered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He went out to the hitching-rack, mounted, and, waving his hand to the few
      bystanders who were eying him curiously, he rode away, his long legs
      swinging back and forth from the flanks of his horse. A quarter of a mile
      outside of the village he came to a portion of the road leading to Jeff
      Wade's house that was densely shaded, and there he drew rein and
      dismounted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar hain't no other way fer 'im to come,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;an' I'm his meat or
      he is mine&mdash;that is, unless the dem fool kin be fetched to reason.&rdquo;

      VIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HERE was a
      quilting-party at Porter's that day. Cynthia had invited some of her
      friends to help her, and the quilt, a big square of colored scraps, more
      or less artistically arranged in stars, crescents, and floral wreaths,
      occupied the centre of the sitting-room. It was stitched to a frame made
      of four smooth wooden bars which were held together at the corners by pegs
      driven into gimlet-holes and which rested on the backs of four chairs. The
      workers sat on two sides of it, and stitched with upward and downward
      strokes, towards the centre, the quilt being rolled up as the work
      progressed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Hattie Mayhew was there, and Kitty Welborn, and two or three others. As
      usual, they were teasing Cynthia about the young preacher.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know he's dead in love,&rdquo; laughed Kitty Welborn. &ldquo;He really can't keep
      from looking at her during preaching. I noticed it particularly one Sunday
      not long ago, and told Matt Digby that I'd be sure to get religion if a
      man bored it into me with big, sad eyes like his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly would go up to the mourners' bench every time he called for
      repentant sinners,&rdquo; said Hattie Mayhew. &ldquo;I went up once while he was
      exhorting, and he didn't even take my hand. He turned me over to Sister
      Perdue, that snaggletoothed old maid who always passes the wine at
      sacrament, and that done me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia said nothing, but she smiled good-naturedly as she rose from her
      chair and went to the side of the quilt near the crudely screened
      fireplace to see that the work was rolled evenly on the frame. While thus
      engaged, her father came into the room, vigorously fanning himself with
      his old slouch hat. The girls knew he had been to the village, and all
      asked eagerly if he had brought them any letters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I clean forgot to go to the office,&rdquo; he made slow answer, as he threw
      himself into a big armchair with a raw-hide bottom near a window on the
      shaded side of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, father,&rdquo; his daughter chided him, &ldquo;you promised the girls faithfully
      to call at the office. I think that was very neglectful of you when you
      knew they would be here to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he usually has a good memory,&rdquo; spoke up Mrs. Porter, appearing in the
      door-way leading to the dining-room and kitchen. She was rolling flakes of
      dough from her lank hands, and glanced at her husband reprovingly.
      &ldquo;Nathan, what <i>did</i> you go and do that way for, when you knew Cynthia
      was trying to make her friends pass a pleasant day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I clean forgot it,&rdquo; Porter said, quite undisturbed. &ldquo;To tell you
      the truth, thar was so much excitement on all hands, with this un runnin'
      in with fresh news, an' another sayin' that maybe it was all a false
      alarm, that the post-office plumb slipped out o' my head. Huh! I hain't
      thought post-office once sense I left here. I don't know whether I could
      'a' got waited on, anyway, fer the postmaster hisse'f was runnin' round
      outside like a chicken with its head chopped off. Besides, I tell you,
      gals, I made up my mind to hit the grit. I never was much of a hand to
      want to see wholesale bloodshed. Moreover, I've heard of many a spectator
      a-gittin' shot in the arms an' legs or some vital spot. No, I sorter
      thought I'd come on. Mandy, have you seed anything o' my fly-flap? When
      company's here you an' Cynthia jest try yoreselves on seein' how many
      things you kin stuff in cracks an' out-o'-way places. I'm gittin' sick an'
      tired o'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan, what's going on in town?&rdquo; broke in Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;What are you
      talking about?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what's goin' on <i>now</i>,&rdquo; Porter drawled out, as he
      slapped at a fly on his bald pate with an angry hand. &ldquo;I say I don't know
      what's goin' on right at this minute, but I know what was jest gittin'
      ready to go on when I skipped. I reckon the coroner's goin' on with the
      inquest ef he ain't afeared of an ambush. Jeff Wade&mdash;&rdquo; Porter
      suddenly bethought himself of something, and he rose, passed through the
      composite and palpable stare of the whole room, and went to the clock on
      the mantel-piece and opened it. &ldquo;Thar!&rdquo; he said, impatiently. &ldquo;I wonder
      what hole you-uns have stuck my chawin'-tobacco in. I put it in the corner
      of this clock, right under the turpentine-bottle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's your fool tobacco,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter exclaimed, running forward and
      taking the dark plug from beneath the clock. &ldquo;Fill your mouth with it,
      maybe it will unlock your jaw. What is the trouble at Springtown?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jest startin' to tell you,&rdquo; said Porter, diving into his capacious
      trousers-pocket for his knife, and slowly opening the blade with his long
      thumb-nail. &ldquo;You see, Jeff Wade has at last got wind o' all that gab about
      Minnie an' Nelson Floyd, an' he sent a war-cry by Pole Baker on hoss-back
      as fast as Pole could clip it to tell Floyd to arm an' be ready at exactly
      twelve o'clock, sharp.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew it would come,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, a combination of finality and
      resignation in her harsh voice. &ldquo;I knew Jeff Wade wasn't going to allow
      that to go on.&rdquo; She was looking at her daughter, who, white and wide-eyed,
      stood motionless behind Hattie Mayhew's chair. For a moment no one spoke,
      though instinctively the general glance went to Cynthia, who, feeling it,
      turned to the window looking out upon the porch, and stood with her back
      to the room. Mrs. Porter broke the silence, her words directed to her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeff Wade will kill that man if he was fool enough to wait and meet him.
      Do you think Floyd waited, Nathan?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, he didn't wait,&rdquo; was Porter's answer. &ldquo;The plucky chap went 'im one
      better. He sent word by Mel Jones to Wade that it would be indecent to
      have a rumpus like that in town on a Saturday, when so many women an'
      childem was settin' round in bullet-range, an' so if it was agreeable he'd
      ruther have it in the open place at Price's Spring. Mel passed me as he
      was goin' to Jeff with that word. It's nearly one o'clock now, an' it's my
      candid opinion publicly expressed that Nelson Floyd has gone to meet a
      higher power. I didn't want to be hauled up at court as a witness, an' so,
      as I say, I hit the grit. I've been tied up in other folks's matters
      before this, an' the court don't allow enough fer witness-fees to tempt me
      to set an' listen to them long-winded lawyers talk fer a whole week on a
      stretch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; exclaimed Hattie Mayhew. &ldquo;I'm right sorry for him. He was
      so handsome and sweet-natured. He had faults and bad ones, if what folks
      say is true, but they may have been due to the hard life he had when he
      was a child. I must say I have always been sorry for him; he had the
      saddest look about the eyes of any human being I ever saw.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And he knew how to use his eyes, too,&rdquo; was the sting Mrs. Porter added to
      this charitable comment, while her sharp gaze still rested on her
      daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was a sound at the window. Cynthia, with unsteady hands, was trying
      to raise the sash. She finally succeeded in doing this, and in placing the
      wooden prop under it. There was a steely look in her eyes and her features
      were rigidly set, her face pale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's very warm in here,&rdquo; they heard her say. &ldquo;There isn't a bit of
      draught in this room. It's that hot cook-stove. Mother, I will&mdash;I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She turned and walked from the room. Mrs. Porter sighed, as she nodded
      knowingly and looked after the departing form.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you notice her face, girls?&rdquo; she asked. &ldquo;It was as white as death
      itself. She looked as if she was about to faint. It's all this talk about
      Floyd. Well, they <i>were</i> sort of friends. I tried to get her to stop
      receiving his attentions, but she thought she knew better. Well, he has
      got his deserts, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And all on account of that silly Minnie Wade,&rdquo; cried Kitty Welborn, &ldquo;when
      you know, as well as I do, Mrs. Porter, that Thad Pelham&mdash;&rdquo; The
      speaker glanced at Nathan Porter, and paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you needn't let up on yore hen-cackle on my account,&rdquo; that blunt
      worthy made haste to say. &ldquo;I'll go out an' look at my new hogs. You gals
      are out fer a day o' pleasure, an' I wouldn't interfere with the workin'
      of yore jaws fer a purty.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter didn't remain to hear Kitty Welborn finish her observation,
      but followed her daughter. In the dining-room, adjoining, an old woman sat
      at a window. She was dressed in dingy black calico, her snowy hair brushed
      smoothly down over a white, deeply wrinkled brow, and was fanning herself
      feebly with a turkey-feather fan. She had Mrs. Porter's features and
      thinness of frames.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, pausing before her, &ldquo;didn't Cynthia come in
      here just now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she did,&rdquo; replied the old woman, sharply. &ldquo;She <i>did</i>. And I
      just want to know, Mandy, what you all have been saying to her in there. I
      want to know, I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We haven't been saying anything to her, as I know of,&rdquo; said the farmer's
      wife, in slow, studious surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you have&mdash;I say, I know you <i>have!</i>&rdquo; The withered hand
      holding the fan quivered in excitement. &ldquo;I know you have; I can always
      tell when that poor child is worried. I heard a little of it, too, but not
      all. I heard them mention Hillhouse's name. I tell you, I am not going to
      sit still and let a whole pack of addle-pated women tease as good a girl
      as Cynthia is plumb to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think they were troubling her,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, her face drawn
      in thought, her mind elsewhere.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know they <i>were!</i>&rdquo; the old woman insisted. &ldquo;She may have hidden it
      in there before you all, but when she came in here just now she stopped
      right near me and looked me full in the face, and never since she was a
      little baby have I seen such an odd look in her eyes. She was about to
      cry. She saw me looking at her, and she come up behind me and laid her
      face down against my neck. She quivered all over, and then she said, 'Oh,
      granny! oh, granny!' and then she straightened up and went right out at
      that door into the yard. I tell you, it's got to let up. She sha'n't have
      the life devilled out of her. If she don't want to marry that preacher,
      she don't have to. As for me, I'd rather have married any sort of man on
      earth when I was young than a long-legged, straight-faced preacher.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say she went out in the yard?&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, absently. &ldquo;I wonder
      what she went out there for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter went to the door and looked out. There was a clothes-line
      stretched between two apple-trees near by, and Cynthia stood at it taking
      down a table-cloth. She turned with it in her arms and came to her mother.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I just remembered,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that there isn't a clean cloth for the
      table. Mother, the iron is hot on the stove. You go back to the girls and
      I'll smooth this out and set the table.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two met. Mrs. Porter took a deep breath. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I'll go back to the company, but I've got something to say, and
      then I'm done for good. I want to say that I'm glad a daughter of mine has
      got the proper pride and spunk you have. I see you are not going to make a
      goose of yourself before visitors, and I'm proud of you. You are the right
      sort&mdash;especially after he's acted in the scandalous way he has, and&mdash;and
      laid you, even as good a girl as you, liable to be talked about for
      keeping company with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl's eyes sank. Something seemed to rise and struggle up within her,
      for her breast heaved and her shoulders quivered convulsively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll fix the cloth,&rdquo; she said, in a low, forced voice, &ldquo;and then I'll set
      the table and call you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter was turning away. &ldquo;I'll try to keep them
      entertained till you come back.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">B</span>ENEATH a big oak
      Pole stood holding his bridle-rein and waiting, his earnest gaze on the
      long road leading to Jeff Wade's farm. Suddenly he descried a cloud of
      dust far ahead, and chuckled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's certainly on time,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;He must 'a' had his hoss already
      hitched out in the thicket. Mel made good time, too. The dern scamp wants
      to see bloodshed. Mel's that sort. By gum! that hain't Wade; it's Mel
      hisse'f, an' he's certainly layin' the lash to his animal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a gallop, Jones bore down on him, riding as recklessly as a cowboy, his
      broad hat in one hand, a heavy switch in the other. He drew rein when he
      recognized Baker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you deliver that message?&rdquo; Pole questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I finally got him alone; his wife seems to suspicion some'n, and
      she stuck to 'im like a leech. She's a jealous woman, Pole, an' I don't
      know but what she kinder thought Jeff was up to some o' his old shines.
      She's in a family-way, an' a little more cranky than common. He was a
      sorter tough nut before he married, you know, an' a man like that will do
      to watch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what did he say?&rdquo; Pole asked, as indifferently as his impatience
      would allow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he said, 'All hunkeydory.' The spring plan ketched him jest right.
      He said that <i>one</i> thing&mdash;o' bloodyin' up the main street in
      town&mdash;had bothered him more than anything else. He admired it in
      Floyd, too. Jeff said: 'By gum! fer a town dude, that feller's got more
      backbone than I expected.. He's a foe wuth meetin', an' I reckon killin'
      'im won't be sech a terrible disgrace as I was afeard it mought be.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But whar are you headin' fer in sech a rush?&rdquo; Pole asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Jones laughed slyly as he put his hat carefully on his shaggy head and
      pressed the broad brims up on the sides and to a point in front. &ldquo;Why,
      Pole,&rdquo; he answered, &ldquo;to tell you the truth, I am headed fer that thar
      spring. I'm goin' to acknowledge to you that, as long as I've lived in
      this world, I hain't never been on hand at a shootin'-scrape. Mighty nigh
      every man I know has seed oodlin's of 'em, but my luck's been agin me. I
      was too young to be in the war, an' about the most excitin' thing I ever
      attended was a chicken-fight, and so I determined to see this through. I
      know a big rock jest above the spring, and I'm a-goin' to git thar in
      plenty o' time. You let me git kivered all but my eyes, an' I'll run the
      resk o' gettin' hit from thar up. Whar <i>you</i> makin' fer, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Oh, I'm on the way home, Mel. I seed the biggest rattlesnake run
      across this road jest now I ever laid eyes on. I got down to settle his
      hash, but I didn't have anything to hit 'im with, an' I'm done stompin' on
      them fellers sence Tobe Baker, my cousin, over at Hillbend, got bliffed in
      the knee-j'int.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, so long,&rdquo; Jones laughed. &ldquo;I'll hunt rattlesnakes some other time.
      Are you plumb shore you hain't got the jimmies ag'in, Pole? Take my advice
      an' don't tell anybody about seein' snakes; it sets folks to thinkin'.
      Why, I seed you once in broad daylight when you swore black spiders was
      playin' sweepstakes on yore shirt-front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So long, Mel,&rdquo; Pole smiled. He made a fair pretence at getting ready to
      mount as Jones galloped away in a cloud of dust. The rider was scarcely
      out of sight when a pair of fine black horses drawing a buggy came into
      view. The vehicle contained Captain Duncan and his daughter Evelyn. She
      was a delicate, rather pretty girl of nineteen or twenty, and she nodded
      haughtily to Pole as her father stopped his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are sure that thing's off, are you, Baker?&rdquo; the planter said, with a
      genial smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, captain.&rdquo; Pole had his eyes on the young lady and had taken off
      his hat, and stood awkwardly swinging it against the baggy knees of his
      rough trousers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm very glad,&rdquo; Duncan said. &ldquo;I heard you'd told some of the crowd
      back at the store that it had been settled, but I didn't know whether the
      report was reliable or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole's glance shifted between plain truth and Evelyn Duncan's refined face
      for a moment, and then he nodded. &ldquo;Oh yes, it was all a mistake, captain.
      Reports get out, you know; and nothin' hain't as bad as gossip is after
      it's crawled through a hundred mouths an' over a hundred envious tongues.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad, as I say,&rdquo; the planter said, and he jerked his reins and
      spoke to his horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      As he whirled away, Pole growled. &ldquo;Derned ef I hain't a-makin' a regular
      sign-post out o' myself,&rdquo; he mused, &ldquo;an' lyin' to beat the Dutch. Ef that
      blasted fool don't hurry on purty soon I'll&mdash;but thar he is now,
      comin' on with a swoop. His hoss is about to run from under 'im, his dem
      legs is so long. Now, looky' here, Pole Baker, Esquire, hog-thief an'
      liar, you are up agin about the most serious proposition you ever tackled,
      an' ef you don't mind what you are about you'll have cold feet inside o'
      ten minutes by the clock. You've set in to carry this thing through or die
      in the attempt, an' time's precious. The fust thing is to stop the blamed
      whelp; you cayn't reason with a man that's flyin' through the air like
      he's shot out of a gun, an' Jeff Wade's a-goin' to be the devil to halt.
      He's got the smell o' blood, an' that works on a mad man jest like it does
      on a bloodhound&mdash;he's a-goin' to run some'n down. The only thing in
      God's world that'll stop a man in that fix is to insult 'im, an' I reckon
      I'll have that to do in this case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Wade was riding rapidly. Just before he reached Pole he drew out his
      big, silver, open-faced watch and looked at it. He wore no coat and had on
      a gray flannel-shirt, open at the neck. Round his waist he wore a wide
      leather belt, from which, on his right side, protruded the glittering butt
      of a revolver of unusual size and length of barrel. Suddenly Pole led his
      own horse round until the animal stood directly across the narrow road,
      rendering it impossible for the approaching rider to pass at the speed he
      was going.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on thar, Jeff!&rdquo; Pole held up his hand. &ldquo;Whar away? The mail-hack
      hain't in yet. I've jest left town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't goin' after no mail!&rdquo; Wade said, his lips tight, a fixed stare
      in his big, earnest eyes. &ldquo;I'm headed fer Price's Spring. I'm goin' to put
      a few holes in that thar Nelson Floyd, ef I git the drap on him 'fore he
      does on me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Pole ejaculated; &ldquo;no, you hain't a-goin' to see him, nuther&mdash;that
      is, not till me'n you've had a talk, Jeff Wade. You seem in a hurry, but
      thar's a matter betwixt me an' you that's got to be attended to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell d' you mean?&rdquo; Wade demanded, a stare of irritated
      astonishment dawning in his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean that Nelson Floyd is a friend o' mine, an' he ain't a-goin'
      to be shot down like a dog by a man that could hit a nickel a hundred
      yards away nine times out o' ten. You an' me's face to face, an' I reckon
      chances 'ud be somewhar about equal. I hain't a brag shot, but I could hit
      a pouch as big as yourn is, at close range, about as easy as you could
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you&mdash;by God! do you mean to take this matter up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Wade slid off his horse and stood facing Pole.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do, Jeff&mdash;that is, unless you'll listen to common-sense.
      That's what I'm here fer. I'm a-goin' to stuff reason into you ef I have
      to make a hole to put it in at. You are a-goin' entirely too fast to live
      in an enlightened Christian age, an' I'm here to call a halt. I've got
      some things to tell you. They are a-goin' to hurt like pullin' eye-teeth,
      an' you may draw yore gun before I'm through, but I'm goin' to make a try
      at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What the hell do you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, hold on, hold on, Jeff!&rdquo; Pole raised a warning hand. &ldquo;Keep that
      paw off'n that cannon in yore belt or thar'll be a war right here before
      you hear my proclamation of the terms we kin both live under. Jeff, I am
      yore neighbor an' friend I love you mighty nigh like a brother, but I'm
      here to tell you that, with all yore grit an' good qualities, you are
      makin' a bellowin' jackass o' yourself. An' ef I let you put through yore
      present plans, you'll weep in repentance fer it till you are let down in
      yore soggy grave. Thar's two sides to every question, an' you are lookin'
      only at yore side o' this un. You cayn't tell how sorry I am about havin'
      to take this step. I've been a friend to yore entire family&mdash;to yore
      brothers, an' yore old daddy, when he was alive. I mighty nigh swore a lie
      down in Atlanta to keep <i>him</i> out o' limbo, when he was arrested fer
      moon-shinin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know all that!&rdquo; growled Wade; &ldquo;but, damn it, you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold yore taters, now, an' listen. You mought as well take yore mind
      off'n that spring. You hain't a-goin' to git at Nelson Floyd without you
      walk over my dead body&mdash;an' thar's no efs an' an's about that. You
      try to mount that hoss, an' I'll kill you ef it's in my power. I say I've
      got some'n to tell you that you'll wish you'd listened to. I know some'n
      about Minnie that will put a new color on this whole nasty business; an'
      when you know it, ef you kill Nelson Floyd in cold blood the law will jerk
      that stiff neck o' your'n&mdash;jerk it till it's limber.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you know some'n about Minnie?&rdquo; The gaunt hand which till now had
      hovered over the butt of the big revolver hung straight down. Wade stood
      staring, his lip hanging loose, a sudden droop of indecision upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know this much, Jeff,&rdquo; Pole said, less sharply, &ldquo;I know you are not on
      the track o' the fust offender in that matter, an' when I prove <i>that</i>
      to you I don't believe you'll look at it the same.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say&mdash;you say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen now, Jeff, an' don't fly off the handle at a well-wisher sayin'
      what he thinks has to be said in justice to all concerned. The truth is,
      you never seed Minnie like other folks has all along. You seed 'er grow up
      an' she was yore pet. To you she was a regular angel, but other folks has
      knowed all along, Jeff, that she was born with a sorter light nature.
      Women folks, with the'r keen eyes, has knowed that ever since she got out
      o' short dresses. Even yore own wife has said behind yore back a heap on
      this line that she was afeard to say to your face. Not a soul has dared to
      talk plain to you, an' even <i>I</i> wouldn't do it now except in this
      case o' life an' death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wade shook back his long, coarse hair. He was panting like a tired dog. &ldquo;I
      don't believe a damn word of what you are a-sayin,&rdquo; he muttered, &ldquo;an' I'll
      make you prove it, by God, or I'll have yore lifeblood!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Listen to me, Jeff,&rdquo; Pole said, gently. &ldquo;I'm not goin' to threaten any
      more. Believe me or not, <i>but listen</i>. You remember when Thad Pelham
      went off to Mexico a year or so ago?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wade made no reply, but there was a look of groping comprehension in his
      great, blearing eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you remember that,&rdquo; Pole went on. &ldquo;Well, you know, too, that he was
      goin' with Minnie a lot about that time&mdash;takin' her buggy-ridin' an'
      to meet-in'. He was a devil in pants, Jeff&mdash;his whole family was bad.
      The men in it would refuse the last call to go in at the gate o' heaven ef
      a designin' woman was winkin' at 'em on the outside. Well, Thad started
      fer Mexico one day, an' at the same time Minnie went on a visit to yore
      brother Joe in Calhoun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She went thar a year ago,&rdquo; Wade put in, &ldquo;fer I bought 'er ticket myself
      at Darley.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told <i>you</i> she went to Calhoun.&rdquo; Pole's eyes were mercifully
      averted. &ldquo;Jeff, I met her an' Thad down in Atlanta.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Wade caught his breath. He shook from head to foot as with a chill.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say&mdash;Pole, you say&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I met 'em comin' out o' the Globe Hotel&mdash;that little resort
      jest off'n Decatur Street. They was comin' out o' the side-door, an' me
      an' them met face to face. Minnie, she turned as white as a sheet, but
      Thad sorter laughed like it was a good joke, an' winked at me. I bowed to
      'em an' passed on, but I seed 'em lookin' back, an' then they motioned to
      me to stop, an' they come to me. Minnie set in to cryin' an' begun tellin'
      me not to take the news back home&mdash;that her an' Thad loved each other
      so much she jest <i>had</i> to play the trick on you an' go as fur as
      Atlanta with 'im. She said he was comin' back after he got located, an'
      that they was goin' to git decently married an' so on. An' that devilish
      Thad smiled an' sorter pulled his cheek down from his left eye an' said,
      'Yes, Pole, we are a-goin' to git married. That is, when the proper times
      comes.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sigh escaped Jeff Wade's tense lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you plumb shore the two done wrong down thar, Baker?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole pulled his mustache and looked at the ground. A smile dawned and died
      on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon they wasn't down thar to attend a Sunday-school
      convention, Jeff. They didn't have that look to me. But I was so worried
      fer fear I mought be doin' a woman injustice in my mind, that, after they
      left me, to make sure, I went in the office o' the hotel. The clerk was
      standin' thar doin' nothin', an' so I axed 'im who that young couple was
      that had jest gone out, an' he laughed an' said they was a newly married
      pair from up in the mountains&mdash;'Mr. an' Mrs. Sam Buncombe,' an' he
      showed me whar Thad had writ the names in his scrawlin' hand-write on the
      book. The clerk said that fer a freshly linked couple they headed off any
      he'd ever had in his bridal-chamber. He said they was orderin' some sort
      o' drink every minute in the day, an' that they made so much racket
      overhead that he had to stop 'em several times. He said they danced jigs
      an' sung nigger songs. He said he'd never married hisse'f&mdash;that he'd
      always been afeard to make the riffle, but that ef he could be shore
      matrimony was like that, that he'd find him a consort 'fore sundown or
      break his neck tryin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Wade put out his hand and laid it heavily on Pole's shoulder.
      &ldquo;Looky' here, Baker,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;if you are lying to me, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold on, <i>hold on</i>, Jeff Wade!&rdquo; Pole broke in sternly. &ldquo;When you use
      words like them don't you look serious! So fur, this has been a friendly
      talk, man to man, as I see it; but you begin to intimate that I'm a liar,
      an' I'll try my best to make you chaw the statement. You're excited, but
      you must watch whar yore a-walkin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I want the truth, by God, <i>I want the truth!</i>&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are a-gittin' it, with the measure runnin' over,&rdquo; Pole said,
      &ldquo;an' that ought to satisfy any reasonable man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you think, then, that Nelson Floyd never done any&mdash;any o' the
      things folks says he did&mdash;that trip to the circus at Darley, when
      Minnie said she was stayin' all night with the Halsey gals over the
      mountains&mdash;that was just report?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I ain't here to say that, <i>nuther</i>,&rdquo; said Pole, most
      diplomatically. &ldquo;Nelson Floyd ain't any more'n human, Jeff. His wings
      hain't sprouted&mdash;at least, they ain't big enough to show through his
      clothes. He's like you used to be before you married an' quit the turf,
      only&mdash;ef I'm any judge&mdash;you was a hundred times wuss. Ef all the
      men concerned in this county was after you like you are after Nelson
      Floyd, they'd be on yore track wuss'n a pack o' yelpin' wolves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, hell! let up on me an' what I've done! I kin take care o' myself,&rdquo;
       Wade snarled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, Jeff,&rdquo; Pole laughed. &ldquo;I was only drappin' them hints on my way
      to my point. Well, Minnie she come back from Atlanta, an' fer three whole
      days she looked to me like she missed Thad, but she got to goin' with the
      Thornton boys, an' then Nelson Floyd run across her track. I ain't here to
      make excuses fer 'im, but she was every bit as much to blame as he was.
      He's been around some, an' has enough sense to git in out o' the rain, an'
      I reckon he had his fun, or he wouldn't be a-settin' at Price's Spring
      waitin' to meet death at the end o' that gun o' yourn.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Jeff Wade turned an undecided, wavering glance upon the towering mountain
      on his right. He drew a deep breath and seemed about to speak, but checked
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But la me! what a stark, ravin' fool you was about to make o' yoreself,
      Jeff!&rdquo; Pole went on. &ldquo;You started to do this thing to-day on yore sister's
      account, when by doin' it you would bust up her home an' make the rest of
      her life miserable.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean that Joe Mitchell, that's been dead-stuck on Minnie sence she was
      a little gal, set up to her an' proposed marriage. They got engaged, an'
      then every old snaggle-toothed busybody in these mountains set in to try
      to bust it up by totin' tales about Floyd an' others to 'im. As fast as
      one would come, Minnie'd kill it, an' show Joe what a foolish thing it was
      to listen to gossip, an' Joe finally told 'em all to go to hell, an' they
      was married, an' moved on his farm in Texas. From all accounts, they are
      doin' well an' are happy, but, la me! they wouldn't be that away long ef
      you'd 'a' shot Nelson Floyd this mornin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say they wouldn't, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, I reckon <i>you</i> wouldn't dance a jig an' sing hallelujah ef you
      was to pick up a newspaper this mornin' an' read in type a foot long that
      yore wife's brother, in another state, had laid a man out stiff as a board
      fer some'n' that had tuck place sometime back betwixt the man an' her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; Wade's glance was now on Pole's face. &ldquo;Huh, I reckon you are right,
      Pole. I reckon you are right. I wasn't thinkin' about that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar was <i>another</i> duty you wasn't a-thinkin' about, too,&rdquo; Pole
      said. &ldquo;An' that is yore duty to yore wife an' childern that would be
      throwed helpless on the world ef this thing had 'a' tuck place to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't see <i>that</i>, anyway,&rdquo; said Wade, dejectedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do, Jeff. You see, ef you'd 'a' gone on an' killed Floyd, after I
      halted you, I'd 'a' been a witness agin you, an' I'd 'a' had to testify
      that I told you, in so many words, whar the <i>rale</i> blame laid, an' no
      jury alive would 'a' spared yore neck.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon that's so,&rdquo; Wade admitted. &ldquo;Well, I guess I'll go back, Pole; I
      won't go any furder with it. I promise you not to molest that scamp. I'll
      not trade any more at his shebang, an' I'll avoid 'im all I kin, but I'll
      not kill 'im as I intended.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you're a-talkin' with a clear head an' a clean tongue.&rdquo; Pole drew a
      breath of relief, and stood silent as Wade pulled his horse around, put
      his foot into the heavy, wooden stirrup, and mounted. Pole said nothing
      until Wade had slowly ridden several paces homeward, then he called out to
      him and beckoned him back, going to meet him, leading his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest thought o' some'n' else, Jeff&mdash;some'n' I want to say fer
      myself. I reckon I won't sleep sound to-night or think of anything the
      rest o' the day ef I don't git it off my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I don't feel right about callin' you to halt so rough jest now, an'
      talkin' about shootin' holes in you an' the like, fer I hain't nothin'
      agin you, Jeff. In fact, I'm yore friend now more than I ever was in all
      my life. I feel fer you <i>way down inside o' me</i>. That look on yore
      face cuts me as keen as a knife. I&mdash;I reckon, Jeff, you sorter feel
      like&mdash;like yore little sister's dead, don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The rough face looking down from the horse filled. &ldquo;Like she was dead an'
      buried, Pole,&rdquo; Wade answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Jeff&rdquo;&mdash;Pole's voice was husky&mdash;&ldquo;don't you ever think o'
      what I said awhile ago about shootin'. Jeff, I jest did that to git yore
      attention. You mought a-blazed away at me, but I'll be danged ef I believe
      I could 'a' cocked or pulled trigger on you to 'a' saved my soul from
      hell.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Same here, old neighbor,&rdquo; said Wade, as he wiped his eyes on his
      shirt-sleeve. &ldquo;I wouldn't 'a' tuck them words from no other man on the
      face o' God's green globe.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Wade had ridden slowly away, Pole mounted his own horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now I'll go tell Nelson that the danger is over,&rdquo; he said. Suddenly,
      however, he reined his horse in and sat looking thoughtfully at the
      ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I won't,&rdquo; he finally decided. &ldquo;He kin set thar an' wonder what's up.
      It won't hurt him to be in doubt, dab blame his hot-blooded skin. Thar I
      was in a hair's-breadth of eternity, about to leave a sweet wife an' kids
      to starvation an' tumble in a bloody grave, jest beca'se a rich chap like
      he is had to have his dirty bout. No, Nelsy, my boy, you look old Death in
      the eye fer awhile; it won't do you no harm. Maybe it'll cool you off a
      little.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Pole Baker rode to the thicket where he had hidden his bag of
      corn-meal that' morning and took it home.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>AT afternoon, for
      Cynthia Porter, dragged slowly along. The quilt was finished, duly
      admired, and laid away. The visiting girls put on their sun-bonnets about
      four o'clock and went home. No further news had come from the village in
      regard to the impending duel, and each girl hurried away in the fluttering
      hope that she would be the first to hear of the outcome.
    </p>
    <p>
      Fifty times during the remainder of the afternoon Cynthia went to the
      front-door to see if any one was passing from whom she might hear what had
      happened, but the road leading by the house was not a main-travelled one,
      and she saw only the shadows fall in advance of the long twilight and
      heard the dismal lowing of the cows as they swaggered homeward from the
      pasture. Then it was night, and with the darkness a great weight descended
      on her young heart that nothing could lift.
    </p>
    <p>
      The simple supper was over by eight o'clock. Her father and mother retired
      to their room, and she went, perforce, to hers. Outside the still night,
      with its pitiless moonlight, seemed to be a vast, breathless thing under
      the awful consciousness of tragedy, deeper than the mere mystery of the
      grave. Dead! Nelson Floyd dead! How impossible a thing it seemed, and yet
      how could it be otherwise? She threw herself on her bed without
      undressing, and lay there staring at her flickering tallow-dip and its
      yellow, beckoning ghost in her tilted mirror. Suddenly she heard a step in
      the hall. It was a faint, shuffling one, accompanied by the soft slurring
      of a hand cautiously sliding along the wall. The girl sat up on the bed
      wonderingly, and then the door was softly opened and her grandmother came
      in, and with bent form advanced to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; the old woman said, raising a warning hand. &ldquo;I don't want your ma
      and pa to know I came here, darling. They wouldn't understand it. But I
      had to come; I couldn't sleep.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, granny, you oughtn't to be up this way!&rdquo; exclaimed Cynthia. &ldquo;You know
      it is long past your bedtime.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know that, honey, I know that,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;but to be late
      once in a while won't hurt me. Besides, as I said, I couldn't sleep,
      anyway, and so I came in to you. I knew you were wide awake&mdash;I felt
      that. You see, honey, your ma can't keep anything&mdash;even anything she
      wants to be silent on has to come out, sooner or later, and I discovered
      what was the matter with you this morning. You see, darling, knowing what
      your trouble was, old granny felt that it was her duty to try to comfort
      you all she could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, granny, granny!&rdquo; cried the girl, covering her face with her hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The trouble is, I don't know what to say,&rdquo; continued the old woman; &ldquo;but
      I thought I'd tell you what pride will do sometimes, when anybody calls in
      its aid. If&mdash;if what they all think is so&mdash;if the young man <i>has</i>
      really lost his life in&mdash;in a matter of such a questionable nature,
      then your womanly pride ought to back you up considerably. I have never
      alluded to it, Cynthia, for I haven't been much of a hand to encourage
      ideas of superiority in one person over another, but away back in the
      history of the Radcliffes and the Cuylers and the Prestons, who were our
      kin in Virginia, I've been told that the women were beautiful, and great
      belles in the society at Richmond, before and, after the Revolution. Why,
      honey, I can remember my grandmother telling us children about being at
      big balls and dinners where George Washington was entertained, and lords
      and ladies of the old country. I was too young to understand what it
      meant, but I remember she told us about the great droves of negroes her
      father owned, and the carriages and silver, and the big grants of land
      from the king to him. One of her uncles was a royal governor, whose wife
      was a lady of high title. I was talking to Colonel Price about a month ago
      at the veteran's meeting at Cohutta Springs, and he said he had run across
      a family history about the Radcliffes where it said all of them came down
      from the crowned heads of England. I believe he was right, putting all I
      remember to what he said, and, lying in bed just now, it struck me that
      maybe one of those ladies away back there would not let a tear drop from
      her proud eyes over&mdash;over a young man who had met with misfortune as
      a consequence of bad conduct. Ever since you were a little girl I have
      been proud of your looks, honey. You have fine, delicate features; your
      hands are small and taper to the end of the fingers, and your ankles are
      slender like a fine-blooded race-horse, and your feet have high insteps
      and are pretty in shape. We are poor; we have been so such a long time
      that almost all record of the old wealth and power has passed out of our
      memory, but a few generations of poverty won't kill well-grounded pride
      and dignity.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, granny, granny, you needn't talk to me so,&rdquo; Cynthia said, calmly. &ldquo;I
      know what you mean, and you sha'n't be ashamed of me. I promise you that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I believe you, Cynthia, for you are showing self-respect right now. Go to
      bed, dear, and take your mind off of it. I'm going now. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, granny.&rdquo; Cynthia stood up, and with her arms around the
      frail, bowed old woman, she tenderly kissed her on the brow and led her to
      the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pride!&rdquo; she muttered, as the old woman's steps rang in the corridor.
      &ldquo;Pride is only a word. <i>This! this!</i>&rdquo;&mdash;she struck her breast&mdash;&ldquo;is
      my soul under a knife. Why did I sit still while she was talking and not
      tell her that he was <i>good&mdash;good</i>&mdash;as good a man as ever
      drew human breath? Why didn't I tell her what Pole Baker's wife told me
      about his carrying food at midnight on his shoulder (through the swamp,
      wet to his waist) to her and the children, when Pole was off on a spree&mdash;making
      her swear almost on a Bible that she never would tell? And why didn't I
      tell her what Mrs. Baker said about his sitting down on the children's bed
      when they were asleep and talking so beautifully about their futures, and
      all the sadness of his own childhood and his anxiety to know who and what
      he was? What if he <i>did</i> meet that Minnie Wade, and she and he&mdash;<i>Oh,
      my God!</i>&rdquo; She stood staring at her pale face in her mirror, and then
      tottered back to the bed and sank upon it, sitting erect, her tense hands
      clutching her knees, as if for support against some invisible torrent that
      was sweeping her away. &ldquo;Dead&mdash;oh! and for <i>that</i> reason&mdash;he,
      Nelson Floyd!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly a sound fell on her ears. She sprang to her feet, straining her
      hearing to catch a repetition of it, her eyes wide, the blood of new life
      bounding in her veins. There it was again, the soft, mellow, insistent
      call of the whippoorwill from down by the grape-arbor. For a moment she
      stood still, crying to herself with an inward voice that had no sound:
      &ldquo;Alive! Alive! Alive!&rdquo; Then blowing out her candle, she sprang to the door
      of her chamber, and opened it, and passed on to the outer one, that was
      never locked, and which opened on the front porch. But there, with her
      hand on the knob, she paused, clutching it tightly, but not turning the
      bolt. Alive; yes, alive, but why? how could it be unless&mdash;unless he
      had killed Jeff Wade? Ah, that was it&mdash;red-handed, and fleeing from
      the arm of the law of man and God, he had come to say good-bye. A memory
      of her past determination never to meet him clandestinely flashed through
      her brain, but it was like overhead lightning that touches nothing, only
      warns man of its power and dies away. She turned the bolt and passed out
      into the night, running, it seemed, almost with the dragging feet of one
      in a nightmare, towards the trysting-place.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, here you are!&rdquo; Nelson Floyd stood in the door-way of the little
      arbor, his arms outstretched. She allowed him to catch her cold, bloodless
      hands and lead her to the rustic seat within.
    </p>
    <p>
      They sat down together. She felt his strong arm encompass her but had not
      the strength or will to resist. He pressed his cheek down on her cold
      brow, then his lips, and clasped one of her hands with his big warm one.
      Still she could not put him off. It was like a perplexing dream. There was
      the horror, and yet here was vague reassurance that at once inspired hope
      and benumbed her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, little girl?&rdquo; he asked, tenderly. &ldquo;I declare you are
      quivering all over.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat up. Pushing him back from her, and twisting her hand from his
      grasp, she looked straight into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Jeff Wade!&rdquo; she gasped. &ldquo;Jeff Wade!&mdash;have you&mdash;did you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I <i>see!</i>&rdquo; he laughed, awkwardly. &ldquo;I might have known you would
      hear about that. But never mind, little girl, the whole of it was gossip&mdash;there
      was nothing in it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;oh, Nelson, you say that you and he did not&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit of it,&rdquo; he laughed again, mechanically. &ldquo;Everybody in town this
      morning was declaring that Jeff Wade was going to kill me on sight, but it
      wasn't true. I haven't seen him to-day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nelson, I heard that he'd actually killed you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Killed me? Oh, that's a good joke!&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;But you must promise me
      never again to pay any attention to such stuff. The idea! Why, Cynthia,
      don't you know better than to believe everything that comes by word of
      mouth in this section? I'll bet somebody started that who really wanted me
      out of the way. I've got enemies, I know that.&rdquo; She drew herself still
      farther from him, eying him half suspiciously through the darkness. Her
      lips were parted; she was getting her breath rapidly, like a feverish
      child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he was mad at you, I know that. You need not tell me an untruth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man is almost justifiable,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;when he wants to keep such
      dirty stuff from young, refined ears like yours. Let's not talk of it any
      more, little girl. Why spoil this delightful meeting with thoughts of such
      things? You have no idea how much I've wanted to see you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;she put out her cold hand to the latticework and drew herself
      up&mdash;&ldquo;why did you whistle for me? You said you'd&mdash;you'd call me
      if you&mdash;you really needed me badly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that's what I did to-night, I assure you,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I felt like
      I just <i>had</i> to see you and talk with you. You see, I knew this thing
      would finally get to you, and that you would worry and perhaps lose sleep
      over it. I knew when you saw me with a whole skin and solid bones that
      you'd&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You flattered yourself that I'd care! Huh, I see! I suppose I'd hate to
      see <i>any one</i> shot down in cold blood at a moment's notice like
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand and laughingly attempted to draw her to him again, but
      she remained leaning against the door-frame.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to be mad at me,&rdquo; he said, pleadingly, &ldquo;now, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I'm going into the house I told you I'd not meet you here after
      all the others have gone to bed, when you whistled as you would to your
      dog, and I want you to know I would not have come if I had not been
      over-excited. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Wait a moment. I really did want to see you particularly, Cynthia&mdash;to
      make an engagement. The young folks are all going over to Pine Grove next
      Sunday afternoon to attend meeting, and I want to take you in my new buggy
      behind my Kentucky horse.&rdquo;

      &ldquo;You couldn't wait till to-morrow to ask me,&rdquo; she said, interrogatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I couldn't wait till to-morrow, for that long, slim 'sky-pilot' will
      run over before breakfast to ask you to go with him. I know that. But can
      I count on you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She hesitated for a moment, then she said, simply: &ldquo;Yes, I'll go with you;
      but I shall leave you now. Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, then. Well, I'll see you Sunday&mdash;I guess that will have
      to do.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>LOYD sat on the
      bench for more than an hour after she had left him. His thoughts were of
      himself. He smoked two cigars moodily. The whole day was retracing its
      active steps before his eyes, from the moment he opened his ledger to do
      his morning's work till now that his naked soul stood shivering in the
      darkness before him. His thoughts bounded from one incident in his life to
      another, each leap ending in a shudder of discontent. Cynthia's dignified
      restraint, and the memory of her helpless, spasmodic leanings both to and
      from him, at once weighted him down and thrilled him. Yes, his almost
      uncontrollable passion was his chief fault. Would he ever be able to
      subdue it and reach his ideal of manhood? Throwing his cigar away, he rose
      to leave. His watch told him it was eleven.
    </p>
    <p>
      He did not go towards the house and out at the gate, but took a nearer way
      through the orchard, reaching the rail-fence a hundred yards below
      Porter's house. He had just climbed over and was detaching himself from
      the detaining clutch of numerous blackberry briers, when he saw a head and
      pair of shoulders rise from a near-by fence-corner.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was Pole Baker who advanced to him in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;By gum!&rdquo; Pole ejaculated. &ldquo;I come as nigh as pease lettin' a pistol-shot
      fly at you. I was passin' an' heard some'n' in the orchard an' 'lowed it
      mought be somebody try in' to rob Porter's sweet-potato bed, an', by the
      holy Moses, it was you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it was me, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The farmer's slow glance left Floyd's face and swept critically along the
      fence to the white-posted gate in the distance.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; he said, and was silent, his eyes roving on to the orchard, where
      his glance hovered in troubled perplexity.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went to see Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; Floyd explained, after a pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, you say you did! Well, I didn't see no light in the parlor when I
      passed jest now'. I was particular to look, fer I've been everywhar to
      find you, an' Porter's was the last place. By gum! I didn't think a chap
      that had been kick'n' the clods o' the grave off'n 'im all day fer a woman
      scrape 'ud run straight to another gal before he knowed whether his hide
      was liable to remain solid or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to see Miss Cynthia,&rdquo; Floyd said, &ldquo;to ask her to go to
      bush-arbor meeting with me Sunday, and I didn't intend to let my affair
      with Jeff Wade interfere with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, that was it! an' that's why you are a-comin' out o' Nathan Porter's
      orchard at eleven o'clock at night, is it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd gazed at his rough friend for an instant, just a touch of
      irritability in his manner as he made answer:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Miss Cynthia and I were sitting in the grape arbor, behind the house. She
      only stayed a minute or two. I sat there a long time after she went in. I
      was smoking and was beastly tired.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see!&rdquo; Pole was slightly mollified, but was still to be heard
      from.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, let me tell you some'n', Nelson,&rdquo; he pursued. &ldquo;Thar hain't no flower
      that ever bloomed an' throwed out sweet smells that's as nice an' purty as
      a pure young gal that's got good, honorable parents, an' the reputation of
      a creature like that is more valuable in my sight than all the gold an'
      diamonds on earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You certainly are right about that,&rdquo; Floyd agreed, coldly, for he was
      secretly resenting Pole's implied warning.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then,&rdquo; Baker said, even more sternly, &ldquo;don't you climb out'n Nathan
      Porter's orchard at this time o' night ag'in, when thar's a gate with a
      latch an' hinges to it right before yore eyes. What ef you'd 'a' been seed
      by some tattlin' busybody? You hain't got no more right to run the risk&mdash;<i>the
      bare risk</i>, I say&mdash;o' castin' a stain on that little gal's name
      than I have to set fire to yore store an' burn it to the ground. The shack
      could be built up ag'in, but that fair name 'ud never be the same ag'in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are thoroughly right, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd said, regretfully. &ldquo;I can see it
      now. But I'm rather sorry to see you throw it at a feller quite so hard.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon I'm sorter upset,&rdquo; the farmer said, half apologetically, as they
      walked on. &ldquo;I reckon it was my talk with Jeff Wade about his sister that
      got me started. That's mighty nigh broke him all to pieces, Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you met Wade!&rdquo; Floyd said, quickly. &ldquo;I thought perhaps you stopped
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You thought I did? What made you think I did?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, when I'd waited till about one o'clock,&rdquo; Floyd replied, &ldquo;I started
      out to Wade's, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you started out thar?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I knew he meant business, and I wanted it settled, one way or the
      other, so that I could go back to work, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Or turn yore toes to the sky, you fool!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I started to say,&rdquo; Floyd went on, &ldquo;that I knew something had interfered
      with his coming, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He'd 'a' shot seventeen holes in you or 'a' put seventeen balls in one!&rdquo;
       Pole cried, in high disgust. &ldquo;I finally fixed him all right, but he wasn't
      in no frame o' mind to have you come to his house an' rub it in on 'im.
      However, you hain't told me what made you think I stopped 'im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why,&rdquo; said Floyd, &ldquo;just as I was starting away from the spring, Mel Jones
      came running down the hill. He'd been hiding behind a big rock up there to
      see the affair, and was awfully disappointed. He begged me to wait a
      little longer, and said he was sure Jeff would come on. Then he told me he
      saw you in the road near Wade's house, and I understood the whole thing. I
      guess I owe my life to you, Pole. It isn't worth much, but I'm glad to
      have it, and I'd rather owe you for it than any one I know. What did you
      say to Wade?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I told 'im all I knowed about that little frisky piece, and opened
      his eyes generally. It's all off, Nelson. He'll let you alone in the
      future. He's badly broke up, but it's mostly over findin' out what the gal
      was.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had reached the point where their ways separated, when they heard
      several pistol-shots on the mountain road not far away, and prolonged
      shouting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;White Caps,&rdquo; said Pole, succinctly. &ldquo;They're out on another rampage. Old
      Mrs. Snodgrass, by some hook or crook, generally gits on to the'r plans
      an' comes over an' reports it to Sally. They are on the'r way now to whip
      Sandy McHugh. They've got reliable proof that he stole Widow Henry's pigs,
      an' they are goin' to make 'im a proposition. They are a-goin' to give 'im
      his choice betwixt a sound whippin' an' reportin' the matter to the grand
      jury. They want him to take the lickin' so he kin stay on an' work fer his
      wife and childem. I reckon that's what he'll decide to do. Sandy ain't in
      no shape to go to the penitentiary.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess he deserves punishment of some sort,&rdquo; said Floyd, abstractedly,
      &ldquo;though it's a pity to have our society regulated by a band of mountain
      outlaws.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They certainly set matters straight over at Darley,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;They
      broke up them nigger dives, an' made it safe fer white women to go to
      prayer-meetin' at night. Say, Nelson, I'm sorter sorry I spoke so hard
      back thar about that little gal's reputation, but the very thought o' the
      slightest harm ever comin' to her runs me wild. I never have spoke to you
      about it, but I tuck a deliberate oath once to protect 'er with my life,
      ef necessary. You see, she's been more than a friend to me. Last winter,
      while I was off on one o' my benders, little Billy got sick. He had the
      croup an' come as nigh as pease dyin'; he could hardly breathe. It was a
      awful night, rainin', snowin', sleetin', an' blowin'. Sally left him long
      enough to run over to Porter's to beg somebody to run fer Dr. Stone, an'
      Cynthia come to the door an' promised it ud be done. She tried to git old
      Nathan up an' dressed, but he was so slow about it&mdash;grumblin' all the
      time about women bein' scared at nothin'&mdash;that Cynthia plunged out in
      the storm an' went them two miles herself, an' fetched the doctor jest in
      the nick o' time. Then she stayed thar the rest o' that night in 'er wet
      clothes, doin' ever'thing she could to help, holdin' Billy in her arms,
      an' rockin' 'im back an' forth, while I was&mdash;by God, Nelson Floyd, I
      was lyin' under the table in Asque's bar so drunk I didn't know my hat
      from a hole in the ground. An' when I heard all about it afterwards, I
      tuck my oath. I was in the stable feedin' my hoss; he heard all I said,
      Nelson, an' I'll be demed ef I don't believe he understood it. I'm here to
      say that ef anybody don't believe I'll put a ball in the man that dares to
      say one word agin that little angel, all he's got to do is to try it! This
      is a hell of a community fer idle talk, anyway, as you know from yore own
      experience, an' ef any of it ever touches that gal's fair name I'll kill
      tatlers as fast as they open the'r dirty mouths.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way to look at it, Pole,&rdquo; Nelson Floyd said, as he turned to
      go; &ldquo;but you'll never have anything to fear in that direction.
      Good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Nelson. I'll see you in the mornin'. I ought to 'a' been in
      bed two hours ago.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>ELL I hear that
      Sandy McHugh tuck his whippin' like a little man last night,&rdquo; Pole
      remarked to Captain Duncan and Floyd the next morning at the store. &ldquo;They
      say he made strong promises to reform, an', gentlemen, I'm here to tell
      you that I believe them White Caps are doin' a purty good work. The
      lickin' Sandy got last night from his neighbors an' well-wishers towards
      him an' his family is a-goin' to work a bigger change in him than a long
      trial at court at the state's expense.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, they say he confessed to the stealing,&rdquo; said the planter. &ldquo;And a
      thing like that certainly ought to be punished in some way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I never stold but once in my life,&rdquo; Baker laughed, reminiscently, &ldquo;an' I
      was sorter drawed into that. I was goin' with a Tennessee drover down to
      Atlanta with a car o' hosses. Old Uncle Abner Daniel was along, an' me'n
      him always was sorter thick. We come to Big Shanty, whar the conductor
      told us we'd barely have time to run out to the side o' the road an' buy a
      snack to eat, an' me'n Uncle Ab made a dash fer the lunch-counter, run by
      a bald-headed Dutchman with a bay-window on 'im. Thar was a pile o'
      sandwiches on the counter marked ten cents apiece, an' we bought two. I
      noticed Uncle Ab sorter twist his face around when he looked in his'n, an'
      then I seed that the ham inside of 'em both wasn't any thicker'n a piece
      o' paper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Look here, Pole' said Uncle Ab, 'I bought a <i>sandwich</i>; I didn't
      agree to pay that fat thief ten cents o' my hard money fer two pieces o'
      bread that don't even smell o' meat.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Well, what you goin' to do about it?' says I.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Do about it?' says he, an' then he sorter winked, an' as the Dutchman
      had turned to his stove whar he was fryin' some eggs, Uncle Ab stuck out
      his long fingers an slid a slice o' ham out o' the top sandwich in the
      stack an' slyly laid it betwixt his bread. I deprived the one under it of
      all the substance it held, an' me'n Uncle Ab was munchin' away when two
      passengers, a big man an' a little, sawed-off one, run up jest as the
      whistle blowed. They throwed down the'r dimes an' grabbed the two top
      sandwiches, an' we all made a break fer the train an' got in together. The
      fellers set right behind me'n Uncle Ab, an' when they begun to eat you
      never heard sech cussin'. 'Damn it, thar hain't a bit o' ham in mine!' the
      big feller said; an' then the little 'un ripped out an oath, an' reached
      up an' tried to git at the bell-cord. 'The damn pot-gutted thief didn't
      even <i>grease</i> mine,' he said, an' they both raised windows an' looked
      back an' shook the'r fists an' swore they'd kill that Dutchman the next
      time they seed 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I'd actually die laughin'. Uncle Ab set thar with the
      straightest face you ever looked at, but his eyes was twinklin' like stars
      peepin' through wet clouds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Finally he said, 'Pole,' said he, 'this experience ort to teach us a
      lesson. You cayn't down wrong with wrong. We started in to beat that
      swindler at his game, an' ended up by robbin' two hungry an' honest
      wayfarers.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd and Captain Duncan laughed. It seemed that there was a disposition
      on the part of both Pole and the planter not to allude to the unpleasant
      affair of the preceding day, though Floyd, in his sensitive attitude in
      regard to it, more than once fancied it was in their minds.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is a personal matter, Floyd,&rdquo; said Duncan, after a silence of
      several minutes, &ldquo;that I have been wanting to speak to you about. It is in
      regard to your parentage. I've heard that you are greatly interested in it
      and would like to have it cleared up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I confess it, captain,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;I suppose that is a feeling that
      would be natural to any one placed as I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Most decidedly,&rdquo; Duncan agreed. &ldquo;And it is my opinion that when you do
      discover what you are looking for, it will all seem so simple and plain
      that you will wonder how you could have missed it so long. I don't think
      it is possible for a thing like that to remain hidden always.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It certainly has foiled me, captain,&rdquo; Floyd replied. &ldquo;I have spent more
      money and made more effort than you would dream of, but met with
      disappointment on every hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you didn't look close enough at home,&rdquo; said Duncan. &ldquo;I confess
      the thing has interested me a good deal, and the more I see of you, and
      observe your pluck and courage, the more I would like to see you discover
      what you want.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, captain,&rdquo; Floyd said, earnestly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm going to confess something else, too,&rdquo; the planter went on, &ldquo;now that
      I see you don't resent my interest. The truth is, I had a talk with
      Colonel Price about it. You know he understands more about genealogy and
      family histories than any man in the county. I asked him if he didn't
      think that your given name, 'Nelson,' might not tend to show that you
      were, in some way, related to a family by that name. Price agreed with me
      that it was likely, and then it flashed on me that I knew a man down in
      Atlanta by the name of Floyd&mdash;Henry A. Floyd&mdash;whose mother was
      one of the South Carolina Nelsons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is it possible?&rdquo; the young merchant asked, leaning forward in almost
      breathless interest.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and he is a man of good standing, but very unsuccessful financially&mdash;a
      man who was educated for the law, and failed at it, and now, I believe,
      lives only on the income from a big farm in Bartow County. I knew him
      quite well when we were both young men; but he never married, and of late
      years he seems soured against everybody. I met him at the Capitol in
      Atlanta only last week, and tried to get him interested in your family
      matter. At first, from his evident surprise that there could be any one
      bearing both those names up here, I thought he was going to reveal
      something that would aid you. But after asking me three or four questions
      about you, he closed up, and that was the end of it. He said he knew
      nothing of your parentage, but that he was sure you were no kin of his.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Say, captain&rdquo;&mdash;Pole Baker broke into the conversation&mdash;&ldquo;would
      you mind tellin' me right here what you told 'im about Nelson? I've seed
      the old cuss; I've been on his farm; I once thought about rentin' land
      from 'im. Did you tell 'im Nelson was a man of high standing here&mdash;that
      he was about the richest young chap in the county an' got more grit than a
      car-load o' sand-paper?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; Duncan laughed. &ldquo;He didn't let me get that far, Baker. In hopes of
      rousing his sympathy, I reckon I laid a good deal of stress on Floyd's
      early misfortune. Of course, I was going to tell him all about you, Floyd,
      but, as I say, he didn't give me a good chance.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were quite right, captain,&rdquo; Floyd returned. &ldquo;Pole would have made me
      appear ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! I'd a got more out o' the old fossil than Captain Duncan did,&rdquo; Pole
      declared, positively, &ldquo;You knowed how to manage men in the war, captain,
      an' you are purty good at bossin' an overseer when you are at a hotel in
      Florida an' he's fillin' a sack in yore corn-crib at home, but I'll bet my
      hat you didn't tackle that feller right. Knowing that he was down in the
      mouth, unlucky, an' generally soured agin the world, I'd never a-tried to
      git 'im interested in pore kin he'd never seed. I'll bet a quart o' rye to
      two fingers o' spilt cider that he'd 'a' talked out o' t'other side o' his
      mouth ef I'd a been thar to sorter show 'im the kind o' kin that he mought
      scrape up ef he turned his hand to it. You let me run agin that old skunk,
      an' I'll have him settin' up the drinks an' axin' me more questions than a
      Dutchman l'arnin' to talk our language. Shucks! I'm jest a mountain-scrub,
      but I know human natur'. Thar comes old Mayhew. He'll order us out&mdash;it's
      treat, trade, or travel with that old skunk.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">H</span>ILLHOUSE had gone
      over to Porter's early that morning. He found Nathan seated on the porch
      in his shirt-sleeves, his heavy shoes unlaced for comfort and a hand-made
      cob-pipe in his mouth. &ldquo;I want to see Miss Cynthia a moment,&rdquo; the preacher
      said, with a touch of embarrassment as he came in at the gate, his hat in
      hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Old Porter rose with evident reluctance. &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll see
      ef I kin find 'er&mdash;ef I do it will be the fust time I ever run across
      her, or any other woman, when she was needed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned in a moment &ldquo;She'll be out in a few minutes,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;She
      told me to tell you to set down here on the porch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillhouse took a vacant seat, holding his hat daintily on his sharp knees,
      and Porter resumed his chair, tilting it backward as he talked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ef you are ever unlucky enough to git married, parson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you'll
      know more about women than you do now, an' at the same time you'll swear
      you know less. They say the Maker of us all has unlimited knowledge, but
      I'll be blamed ef I believe He could understand women&mdash;even ef he <i>did</i>
      create 'em. I'm done with the whole lot!&rdquo; Porter waved his hand, as if
      brushing aside something of an objectionable nature. &ldquo;They never do a
      thing that has common-sense in it. I believe they are plumb crazy when it
      comes to tacklin' anything reasonable. I'll give you a sample. Fer the
      last ten years I have noticed round about here, that whenever a man died
      the women folks he left sent straight to town an' bought a high-priced
      coffin to lay 'im away in. No matter whether the skunk had left a dollar
      to his name or not, that Jew undertaker over thar at Darley, to satisfy
      family pride, sent out a coffin an' trimmin's to the amount of an even
      hundred dollars. I've knowed widows an' orphans to stint an' starve an' go
      half naked fer ten years to pay off a debt like that. Now, as I'm
      financially shaped, I won't leave but powerful little, an' that one thing
      worried me considerable. Now an' then I'd sorter spring the subject on my
      women, an' I found out that they thought a big splurge like that was the
      only decent way to act over a man's remains. Think o' the plumb
      foolishness, parson, o' layin' a man away on a silk-plush cushion after
      he's dead, when he's slept all his life on a common tick stuffed with
      corn-shucks with the stubs on 'em. But that's <i>women!</i> Well, I set to
      work to try to beat 'em at the game, as fur as <i>I</i> was concerned. I
      'lowed ef I made my preparations myself ahead o' time, with the clear
      understandin' that I wanted it that away, why, that no reasonable person
      would, or could, raise objections.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; Hillhouse said, his mind evidently on something else.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may see&mdash;an' any other reasonable <i>man</i> could&mdash;but
      you don't see what them women done.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, to go on. I went down to Swinton's new mill, whar he was sawin' out
      pine planks, an' set around all mornin', an' whenever I seed a solid
      heart-plank run out, I'd nab it an' lay it aside. Then, when I'd got
      enough to make me a good, roomy box, I axed 'im what the pile was wuth an'
      got the lot at a bargain, beca'se times was dull an' I was on the spot.
      Well, I hauled the planks home on my wagon an' unloaded at the barn. The
      women, all three, come out like a lot o' hens peckin' around an' begun to
      ax questions. They 'lowed I was goin' to make some shelves fer the
      smoke-house, to lay hams an' shoulders on, an' they was powerful tickled.
      I didn't let 'em know right then. But the next day when Jim Long come with
      his hammer an' nails an' saw an' plane, an' stood me up agin the wall in
      the woodshed, an' started to measure me up an' down an' sideways, they
      begun to scream an' take on at a desperate rate. It was the fust time I
      ever heard mournin' at my own funeral, an' it sorter upset me; but I told
      Jim to go ahead, an' he did start, but, la me! The whole lay-out run to
      'im an' got around 'im an' threatened, an' went on at sech a rate that he
      throwed up the job an' went home. I got mad an' went off fishin', an' when
      I come back I found all o' them fine, new planks split up into kindlin'
      fer the stove, an' it wasn't a week 'fore my burial outfit was turned into
      ashes. I kin see now that when my time comes my folks will rake an' scrape
      to git up money to put me in a box so thin that a dead man could kick a
      hole in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They have their way of looking at such matters,&rdquo; the preacher ventured,
      awkwardly. &ldquo;Death is a serious thing, brother Porter, and it affects most
      people deeply.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It hain't so serious on a cash basis as it is on a credit,&rdquo; Nathan
      declared. &ldquo;But thar Cynthia comes now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm an early bird, Miss Cynthia.&rdquo; Hillhouse was actually flushed. &ldquo;That
      is, I don't mean to hint that you are a worm, you know; but the truth is,
      I was afraid if I didn't come quick some hawk of a fellow would bear you
      away to bush-arbor meeting next Sunday afternoon. Will you let me take
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's face clouded over. &ldquo;I'm very sorry,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;but I have
      already promised some one else.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; Hillhouse could not disguise his disappointment. &ldquo;Are
      you going with&mdash;with&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Floyd asked me,&rdquo; the girl answered, &ldquo;and I told him I'd go. I'm very
      sorry to disappoint you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cynthia&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter had approached and stood in the door-way,
      staring perplexedly at her daughter&mdash;&ldquo;you told me last night just
      before you went to bed that you had no engagement for Sunday. Have you had
      a note already this morning?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, in some confusion, avoided her mother's sharp, probing look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't matter,&rdquo; she said, lamely. &ldquo;I've promised to go with Mr.
      Floyd, and that is sufficient.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, that is sufficient, of course,&rdquo; Hillhouse said, still under his
      cloud of disappointment, &ldquo;and I hope you will have a pleasant time. The
      truth is, Floyd is hard to beat at anything. He has a way about him that
      wins the&mdash;perhaps I may say&mdash;the sympathy of nearly all ladies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reply of some sort was struggling for an outlet in Cynthia's rapidly
      rising and falling bosom, but her mother forestalled her with tight lips
      and eyes that were flashing ominously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Brother Hillhouse,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;a man of that stamp has more influence
      over girls of the present generation than any other kind. Let a man be
      moral, religious, and sober, and thoughtful of the reputations of women,
      and he is shoved aside for the sort of men who fight duels and break
      hearts and ruin happy homes for their own idle gratification.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Porter, I didn't mean to raise such a&mdash;a point as that,&rdquo;
       Hillhouse stammered. &ldquo;I'm sure Miss Cynthia appreciates all that is good
      in humanity; in fact, I think she leans decidedly that way. I couldn't
      expect her to let a little public gossip turn her against a friend whom
      she believes in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mr. Hillhouse,&rdquo; Cynthia said, drawing herself up to her full
      height and turning to go in. &ldquo;I appreciate the way you look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the house, walking very straight and not looking back.
    </p>
    <p>
      Porter stood up and knocked the ashes from his pipe in his hard, broad
      hand. &ldquo;Do you see that thar gate, parson?&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;Well, you take a
      fool's advice an' go home, an' come back some other time. Neither one o'
      them women know what they are a-talkin' about, an' they'll have you as
      crazy as they are in ten minutes ef you try to follow 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Hillhouse had gone, Mrs. Porter went back into the sitting-room and
      stood over Cynthia as the girl sat sewing at a window.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may <i>think</i> you've got my eyes closed,&rdquo; the old woman said, &ldquo;but
      you haven't. You didn't have any engagement with Nelson Floyd last night
      at supper, and you either saw him after we went to bed or you have had a
      secret note from him this morning.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Have it your own way,&rdquo; Cynthia said, indifferently, and hot with vexation
      she bent her head over her work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was watching your face this morning, too,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter went on, &ldquo;when
      your pa came in and said that Wade did not meet Floyd at the spring, and I
      noticed that you did not seem at all surprised. I'll get at the bottom of
      this, now you see if I don't!&rdquo; And white with suppressed anger, Mrs.
      Porter turned away.
    </p>
    <p>
      As she went out Mrs. Radcliffe, with a tottering step, came into the room
      and drew near to Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am worried about your mother,&rdquo; she said, standing with her thin hand
      resting on the window-frame. &ldquo;She troubles so much over small things. I
      shudder when I think about it, Cynthia; but I'm afraid she'll go like your
      aunt did. It seems to be inherited from your grandfather's side of the
      family.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really afraid of that, granny?&rdquo; The girl looked up, a serious
      expression dawning in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't know as I think she'd actually kill herself, as Martha did,
      but if this goes on her mind certainly will give way. It's not natural&mdash;it's
      too great a strain for one human brain to stand. She didn't sleep a wink
      last night I know that, for I woke up several times and heard her moving
      about and sighing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor mamma!&rdquo; Cynthia said, regretfully, to herself, as her grandmother
      moved slowly from the room. &ldquo;And I spoke disrespectfully to her just now.
      Besides, perhaps I have given her cause to worry, from her stand-point.
      God forgive me, I really <i>did</i> go out to meet him that way, and if
      she thinks it would be so bad, what must he think? Is it possible for him
      to class me with&mdash;to think of me as&mdash;as he does of&mdash;Oh!&rdquo;
       and with a hot flush burning her face, Cynthia rose hastily and put her
      work away.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>T one o'clock the
      following Sunday afternoon Nelson Floyd drove up to Porter's gate in his
      new buggy, behind his spirited Kentucky thorough-bred. Nathan Porter in
      his stockinged feet, for the day was warm, stood on the porch, and as
      Floyd reined in, he walked down the steps and out to the gate, leaning
      over it lazily, his slow, pleased glance critically sweeping the horse
      from head to foot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got you a dandy at last,&rdquo; was his observation. &ldquo;I used to be
      some'n' of a judge. Them's the slimmest legs fer sech a good stout body I
      ever seed. He totes his head high without a check-rein, too, an' that's
      purty. I reckon you come after Cynthia. She'll be out here in a minute.
      She knows you've come; she kin see the road from the window o' her room.
      An' I never knowed a woman that could keep from peepin' out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm in no hurry at all,&rdquo; Floyd assured him. &ldquo;It's only ten miles, and
      we can easily make it by the three o'clock service.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, I reckon it don't make no odds to you whether you hold <i>yore</i>
      meetin' in that hug-me-tight or under the arbor. I know my choice 'ud 'a'
      been jest one way when I was on the turf. Camp-meetin's an' bush-arbor
      revivals used to be our hay-time. Us boys an' gals used to have a great
      way o' settin' in our buggies, jest outside, whar we could chat all we
      wanted to, jine in the tunes, an' at the same time git credit fer properly
      observin' the day.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's about the way the young people look at it now,&rdquo; Floyd said, with a
      smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon this is a sort o' picnic to you in more ways than one,&rdquo; Porter
      remarked, without a trace of humor in his tone, as he spat over the gate
      and wiped his chin on his bare hand. &ldquo;You ort to enjoy a day o' freedom,
      after waitin' two hours at that spring fer Jeff Wade. Gee whiz! half o'
      Springtown was behind barracks, sayin' prayers an' beggin' the Lord to
      spare the town from flames. I didn't stay myself. I don't object to
      watchin' a fisticuff match once in a while, but fellers in a
      powder-and-ball battle like that seem to try to mow down spectators as
      hard as they do the'r man. Then I don't like to be questioned in court. A
      feller has to forgit so dern much, ef he stands to his friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we avoided trouble,&rdquo; said Floyd, in evident aversion to a topic so
      keenly personal. &ldquo;So you like my horse! He is really the best I could get
      at Louisville.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon.&rdquo; Porter spat again. &ldquo;Well, as you say, Wade <i>will</i> shoot
      an' he kin, too. When he was in the war, they tell me his colonel wanted
      some sharpshooters an' selected 'im to&mdash;but thar's that gal now. Gee
      whiz! don't she look fluffy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For the most part, the drive was through the mountains, along steep roads,
      past yawning gorges, and across rapid, turbulent streams. It was an ideal
      afternoon for such an outing, and Cynthia had never looked so well, though
      she was evidently fatigued. Floyd remarked upon this, and she said: &ldquo;I
      don't know why it was, but I waked at three o'clock this morning, and
      could not get back to sleep before father called me at six. Since then I
      have been hard at work. I'm afraid I shall feel very tired before we get
      back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You must try not to think of fatigue.&rdquo; Floyd was admiring her color, her
      hair, her eyes. &ldquo;Then you ought to relax yourself. There is no use sitting
      so erect; if you sit that way the jolting over this rough road will break
      you all to pieces. Don't lean so far from me. I'm not going to hurt you.
      I'm glad I beat Hillhouse to you. I saw him going to your house the next
      morning. I know he asked you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he asked me,&rdquo; Cynthia said, &ldquo;and I was sorry to disappoint him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd laughed. &ldquo;Well, the good and the bad are fighting over you, little
      girl. One man who, in the eyes of the community, stands for reckless
      badness, has singled you out, and thrown down the gauntlet to a man who
      represents the Church, God, and morality&mdash;both are grimly fighting
      for the prettiest human flower that ever grew on a mountain-side.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't like to hear you talk that way.&rdquo; Cynthia looked him steadily in
      the eyes. &ldquo;It sounds insincere; it doesn't come from your heart. I don't
      like your compliments&mdash;your open flattery. You say the same things to
      other girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no; I beg your pardon, but I don't. I couldn't. They don't inspire
      them as you do. You&mdash;you tantalize me, Cynthia; you drive me crazy
      with your maddening reserve&mdash;the way you have of thinking things no
      man could read in your face, and above it all, through it all, your
      wonderful beauty absolutely startles me&mdash;makes me at times unable to
      speak, clogs my utterance, and fires my brain. I don't know&mdash;I can't
      understand it, but you are in my mind all day long, and at night, after my
      work is over, I want to wander about your house&mdash;not with the hope of
      having you actually come out, you know, but to enjoy the mere fancy that
      you have joined me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A reply was on her hesitating lips, but his ardor and impetuosity swept it
      away, and she sat with lowered lashes looking into her lap. The horse had
      paused to drink at a clear brook running across the road. All about grew
      graceful, drooping willows. It was a lonely spot, and it seemed that they
      were quite out of the view of all save themselves. Cynthia's pink hand lay
      like a shell in her lap, and he took it into his. For an instant it
      thrilled as if the spirit of resistance had suddenly waked in it, and then
      it lay passive. Floyd raised it to his lips and kissed it, once, twice,
      several times. He held it ecstatically in both his own, and fondled it.
      Then suddenly an exclamation of surprise escaped Cynthia's lips, and with
      her eyes glued on some object ahead, she snatched her hand away, her face
      hot with blushes. Following her glance, Floyd saw a man with his coat on
      his arm rising from the ground where he had been resting on the moss. It
      was Pole Baker, and with his shaggy head down, his heavy brows drawn
      together, he came towards them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was jest waitin' fer somebody to pass an' give me a match,&rdquo; he said to
      Floyd, almost coldly, without a glance at Cynthia. &ldquo;I'm dyin' to smoke
      this cigar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What are you doing out afoot?&rdquo; Floyd asked, as he gave him several
      matches.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm goin' to meetin', too. I know a short foot-path through the
      mountains. Sally an' the chil-dem didn't want to come, an' I'd a heap
      ruther walk five miles than to ride ten over a road like this 'un. I'd
      sorter be afeard of a mettlesome hoss like that'un. Ef he was to git
      scared an' break an' run, neither one o' you'd escape among these cliffs
      an' gullies.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can hold him in,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;Well, we'd better drive on. Do you
      think you can get there as soon as we do, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't miss it much,&rdquo; said the farmer, and they saw him disappear in a
      shaded path leading down the mountain-side.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He puzzles me,&rdquo; Floyd said, awkwardly. &ldquo;For a minute I imagined he was
      offended at something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He saw you&mdash;holding my hand.&rdquo; Cynthia would not say <i>kissing</i>.
      The word had risen to her tongue, but she instinctively discarded it.
      &ldquo;He's been almost like a brother to me He has a strong character, and I
      admire him very much. I always forget his chief weakness; he never seems
      to me to be a drunkard. He has the highest respect for women of any man I
      ever knew. I'm sorry&mdash;just now&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, never mind Pole,&rdquo; Floyd broke in, consolingly. &ldquo;He's been a young man
      himself, and he knows how young people are. Now, if you begin to worry
      over that little thing, I shall be miserable. I set out to make you have a
      pleasant drive.&rdquo;

      arrived at the bush-arbor, a rough shed upon which rested a roof of
      freshly cut boughs of trees and on which there were benches without backs.
      The ground was strewn with straw, and at the far end was a crude platform
      and table where several ministers sat.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving his companion near the main entrance, Floyd led his horse some
      distance away before he could find a suitable place to hitch him.
      Returning, he found a seat for himself and Cynthia near the rear. They had
      not been there long before Pole Baker slouched in, warm and flushed from
      his walk, and sat directly across the aisle from them. Floyd smiled and
      called Cynthia's attention to him, but Pole stared straight at the pulpit
      and neither looked to the right nor left. Floyd noticed a farmer bend over
      and speak to him, and was surprised to see that Pole made no response
      whatever. With a puzzled expression on his face, the farmer sank back into
      his seat.
    </p>
    <p>
      The meeting was opened with prayer and a hymn. Then Hillhouse, who had
      arrived a little late, came in, a Bible and hymn-book in hand, and went
      forward and sat with the other ministers. Floyd noted the shifting look of
      dissatisfaction on his thin face, and his absent-minded manner, as he
      exchanged perfunctory greetings with those around him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; Floyd said to himself, &ldquo;he's hard hit, and no wonder.&rdquo; He
      glanced at the fair face at his elbow and thrilled from head to foot. She
      was certainly all that a woman could possibly be.
    </p>
    <p>
      Then there was a rousing sermon from the Rev. Edward Richardson, an
      eloquent mountain evangelist. His pleadings bore immediate fruit. Women
      began to shed tears, and sob, and utter prayers aloud. This was followed
      by tumultuous shouting, and the triumphant evangelist closed his talk by
      asking all who felt like it to kneel where they were and receive prayers
      for their benefit. Half of the congregation fell on their knees. &ldquo;Did you
      see that?&rdquo; Floyd whispered to Cynthia, and he directed her attention to
      Pole Baker, who was kneeling on the ground, his great, heavily shod feet
      under the seat in front of him, his elbows on his own bench, and his big,
      splaying hands pressed over his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor fellow!&rdquo; she whispered back, &ldquo;he is making fresh resolutions to quit
      drinking, I suppose. I'm so sorry for him. He tries harder to reform for
      the sake of his wife and children than any man I know. Sometimes I am
      afraid he never will succeed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps not,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;You see, I know what it is, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, of course, it almost got me down once. There was a point in my life
      when I could have been blown one way or the other as easily as a feather.
      I don't want to pose as being better than I am, and I confess that I am
      actually afraid at times that it may again get the best of me. God only
      knows how a man has to fight a thing like that after it has once become a
      habit. As long as matters are like they are now, I can hold my own, I am
      sure; but I actually believe if I had to meet some absolutely crushing
      blow to all my hopes and aspirations, I'd&mdash;I'd really be as weak as
      Pole is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; said Cynthia, raising her frank eyes to his. &ldquo;I
      don't believe a word of it,&rdquo; she repeated, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't? Well, perhaps your faith will save me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The prayer over, the preacher next called on all who felt that they needed
      special spiritual help in any particular trial, affliction, or trouble to
      come forward and give him their hands. Several men and women responded,
      and among them, to Floyd's growing astonishment, was Pole Baker. He stood
      erect at his seat for an instant, and then, with his long arms swinging at
      his sides, he walked up and shook hands stiffly with the minister.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were right about it,&rdquo; Floyd said to Cynthia. &ldquo;I reckon he's making
      new resolutions. But where is the fellow going?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They saw Pole, after releasing the preacher's hand, turn out at the side
      of the arbor, and slowly stalk away towards the spot where Floyd had
      hitched his horse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps he's going to start back home,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &ldquo;It's getting late
      and cloudy, and he has a long walk before him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;And footing it through the woods as dark as it
      is even now is no simple matter; though Pole really has the instincts of a
      red Indian. But I don't understand it, for he is not headed towards home.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was another earnest talk from another preacher, and then Hillhouse
      closed the meeting with a prayer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Cynthia at the arbor, Floyd went down for his horse. He was not
      far from the buggy when he saw Pole Baker rise from a flat stone upon
      which he had been seated. Without looking at him, Pole went to the
      hitch-rein and unfastened it, and led the restive animal around in the
      direction he was to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Much obliged to you, old man,&rdquo; Floyd said, deeply touched by the action.
      &ldquo;I could have done that myself.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, Nelson,&rdquo; Pole responded; &ldquo;but I've got some'n' to say to you,
      an' as it is late an' may take a minute or two, I thought I'd save all the
      time I could an' not keep yore little partner waitin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you want to see me, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole hesitated, his glance on the ground; the sockets of his big eyes were
      full-looking, and the muscles of his face and great neck were twitching.
      Presently he stared Floyd steadily in the eyes and began:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nelson, you've knowed me a good many years in the way one man knows a
      friend an' neighbor, or even a brother, but you don't plumb understand me
      yit. The Lord God Almighty's made men side by side in life as different as
      two kinds o' plants, or two sorts o' minerals. Me'n' you is friends, an'
      I'm a-goin' to say at the start that I love you as a brother, but we see
      things different&mdash;me'n' you do&mdash;we act different about some
      things. That's what I want to see you about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; Floyd had never been more perplexed in his life, but he
      waited for Pole's explanation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't here to reflect on the character of women in general, nuther,&rdquo;
       said Baker, &ldquo;though what I say mought sound like it to the shallow-minded.
      I'm here to tell you that the Lord God has made some o' the sweetest an'
      best an' purest women that ever lived unable to resist the fire the devil
      kindles in some men's eyes. Jest as the Almighty allowed Old Nick to play
      smash right among the elected angels o' heaven tell he was kicked out, so
      does he let 'im play hell an' damnation with the best an' purest here on
      earth, usin' as his devilish instrument men who excuse the'rselves on the
      plea that it's human natur'. A good woman will sometimes be as helpless
      under a hot-blooded man's eye and voice as a dove is when it flutters an'
      stands wonderin' before a rattlesnake that means to devour it soul and
      body.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, what's all this mean?&rdquo; Floyd asked, slightly irritated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait an' see, dern yore hide!&rdquo; said Pole. &ldquo;Ef I kin afford to talk to
      you when I'm due at my home an' fireside, you kin afford to listen, fer ef
      it don't do you some good, it will be the beginnin' o' more harm than you
      ever had to tackle in yore short life. I want to tell you, Nelson, that
      that little woman you drove out here has been as true a friend to me as <i>you</i>
      have, an' if I have to side with one or the other, it will be with the
      weakest one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's made sacrifices fer me. She saved little Billy's life, an' one day
      while I was lyin' too drunk to hold my head up in the swamp betwixt her
      daddy's house an' mine, she found me thar an' run an' fetched fresh water
      in my hat, an' bathed my nasty, bloated face with her wet handkerchief,
      an' kept tellin' me to brace up an' not go home that away an' make my wife
      feel bad. She done that, Nelson Floyd, <i>an', by the holy God</i>, ef you
      think I'm a-goin' to set idle an' even <i>think</i> thar's <i>a bare resk</i>
      o' her bein' made unhappy by a big, strappin' thing in pants, an' a vest,
      an' coat, an' a blue neck tie, you've got little enough sense to need a
      guardeen to look after yore effects. I don't say thar <i>is</i> danger nor
      thar hain't, but I seed you doin' a thing back thar on the road that
      didn't strike me as bein' plumb right, coupled with what I seed when you
      climbed over the fence o' Nathan Porter's orchard nigh midnight not long
      back. I've already told you I love you like a brother, but while meetin'
      was goin' on I made up my mind to say this to you. I got down at the
      preacher's invite an' prayed on it, an' I went forward an' give 'im my
      hand on it, axin' the sanction o' the Lord on it, an' I'm here to tell you
      to yore teeth, Nelson, that ef a hair o' that bonny head is harmed <i>through
      you</i> I will kill you as I would a p'ison snake! Now, I've said it. I'd
      'a' had to say it ef you had been my twin brother, an' I'm not a-goin' to
      be sorry fer it, nuther. Yore a good, well-meanin' young man, but you
      ain't yorese'f when you give way to hot blood.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd was standing behind the neck of his horse, and for an instant Pole
      could not see his face. There was silence for a moment. Then Floyd came
      round the horse and stood facing the mountaineer. He was pale, his lower
      lip was twitching; there was a look in his eyes Baker had never seen there
      before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I'd shoot any other man on God's earth for talking to me
      as you have.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean you'd <i>try</i>, Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean I'd try; but I can't be mad at you. We've been too close for
      that, Pole. I admire you more than any man alive. With all your faults,
      you have done more, in the long run, to lift me up than any other
      influence. I don't know what to say to you. I&mdash;I feel your words
      keenly, but you understand that I cannot, after what you have said, and
      the way you've said it, make promises. That would really be&mdash;be an
      insult to&mdash;to the lady in question, and an acknowledgment that no
      brave man could make to another.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I understand that, Nelson.&rdquo; And Pole, with a softened face, held out his
      big, warm hand. &ldquo;Shake, old boy. Let it all pass. Now that you understand
      me, I'm goin' to trust you like a friend. No good man will harm the sister
      of a friend, noway, an' that's what she is to me. She's my little sister,
      Nelson. Now, you go take 'er home. I don't like the looks o' that cloud in
      the west,' an' I don't like the way that hoss o' your'n keeps layin' back
      his ears an' snortin' at ever' leaf that blows by.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>LOYD drove on to
      the bush-arbor and helped Cynthia into the buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Was that Pole Baker talking to you?&rdquo; she questioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he wanted to speak to me,&rdquo; said Floyd, seriously. &ldquo;He unhitched my
      horse and turned him around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose he is making resolutions to reform?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd shrugged his shoulders unconsciously. &ldquo;Yes, he's always doing that
      sort of thing. He's afraid there may be a storm, too. He's the best
      weather prophet I know. If the cloud were behind us I shouldn't be
      concerned at all, for Jack could outrun it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were driving into a lonely, shaded part of the road, and there they
      noticed more plainly the darkness that had rapidly fallen over the
      landscape. Cynthia shivered, and Floyd tried to see the expression of her
      face, but she was looking down and he was unable to do so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you really afraid?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was thinking about how narrow the road is,&rdquo; she made answer, &ldquo;and of
      the awful cliffs along beside it. Then Jack seems restless and excited. If
      the lightning were to begin to flash, or should strike near us, he might&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry,&rdquo; Floyd broke in, calmly. &ldquo;It is this long, dark road that
      makes you nervous. We'll get out of it in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But they were delayed. Jack, frightened at some imaginary object ahead,
      paused, and with his fore-feet firmly planted in front of him, he stood
      snorting, his ears thrown back. His master gently urged him to go on, but
      he refused to move. Then Floyd touched his flanks with the lash of the
      whip, but this only caused the animal to rear up in a dangerous manner and
      start to turn round. The road was too narrow for this, however, and
      throwing the reins into Cynthia's lap, Floyd got out and went to the
      horse's head, and holding to the bridle, he gently stroked the face and
      neck of the animal. But although Floyd tried, Jack would not be led
      forward. The situation was really grave, for the time was passing and
      night was already upon them. From his position at the animal's head, Floyd
      could barely see Cynthia in her white shawl and dress. Along the black
      horizon the lightning was playing, and the rising wind bore to their faces
      fine drops of rain. It was a sudden crash of thunder behind them that made
      the horse start forward, and it was with some difficulty that Floyd got
      into the buggy from behind. Then they dashed forward at a perilous speed.
      On they went, over the rough road. Even out in the open it was now dark,
      and in the distance they heard the ominous roar and crash of the
      approaching storm. The situation was indeed critical. Once more they ran
      into a road so dark that they could scarcely see Jack's head. Suddenly
      Floyd drew rein, stopped the quivering horse, and looked closely at the
      ground. Cynthia heard an exclamation of dismay escape his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; she asked. He made no answer till she had repeated her
      question.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This is the same road we passed over half an hour ago,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;We have
      gone the wrong way. We are lost, little girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Even at that grave moment he felt a thrill of admiration at her coolness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;we must make the best of it and not get excited. If we
      lose our heads there is no telling what may happen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What a brave little woman you are!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Do you remember? The road
      forks about a quarter of a mile ahead; when we went by just now, we took
      either the right or the left, but I've forgotten which.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We took the right,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I remember that distinctly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then we must take the left this time&mdash;that is, if you are sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm very sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good; then we must drive on as fast as we can.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'd better go slowly,&rdquo; Cynthia cautioned him. &ldquo;The road is very, very
      dangerous, and if Jack should become frightened as we are passing a cliff
      there is no telling what&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She did not finish, for there was a bright flash of lightning in their
      faces, followed by a deafening clap of thunder on the mountain-side above
      them. With a terrified snort, Jack plunged onward. They reached the point
      where the roads divided, and Floyd managed to pull the animal into the
      right one. For half an hour they sped onward. Every effort Floyd made to
      check the horse was foiled; the spirited animal seemed to have taken the
      bit between his teeth. Then the storm broke upon them in alarming fury,
      and they suddenly found themselves before a high, isolated building. The
      horse, as with almost human instinct, had paused.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's Long's mill,&rdquo; Floyd told Cynthia. &ldquo;It's not in use. Pole and I
      stopped here to rest when we were out hunting last month. The door is not
      locked. There is a shed and stable behind for horses. We must get in out
      of danger.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia hesitated. &ldquo;Is it the only thing?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it might cost us our lives to drive on, and it is two miles to the
      nearest house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then.&rdquo; He was already on the ground, and she put her hands on
      his shoulders and sprang down.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, run up the steps,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The door opens easily. I'll lead Jack
      around to the shed and be back in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She obeyed, and when he returned after a few moments he found her on the
      threshold waiting for him, her beautiful, long hair blown loose by the
      fierce wind.
    </p>
    <p>
      They stood side by side in the darkness for a few minutes, and then a
      torrent of rain dashed down upon the roof like tons of solid matter, which
      threatened to crush the building like an egg-shell. He pushed her back,
      and with a great effort managed to close the big sliding-door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must keep the wind out,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;If we don't the mill will be blown
      away.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was now too dark for them to see each other at all, and the roar of the
      storm rendered speech between them almost impossible. She suddenly felt
      his hands grasp hers, and then he shouted, as he held them in his tight
      clasp: &ldquo;There is a big pile of fodder over there against the wall. Come,
      sit down. There is no telling how long this may last, and you are already
      fagged out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She offered no resistance, and he cautiously led her through the darkness
      till he felt the fodder under his feet. Then he bent down and raked a
      quantity of it together and again took her hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sit here,&rdquo; he said, gently pushing her downward. &ldquo;It is dry and warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was right. The soft bed of sweet-smelling corn leaves felt very
      comfortable to the tired girl. He laughed out impulsively as he pulled a
      quantity of the fodder near to her and sat down on it, locking his arms
      over his knees. &ldquo;This isn't so very bad, after all,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;You know,
      it might have been a great deal worse. Jack's well housed, and this old
      mill has withstood a thousand storms.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, and he leaned nearer till his lips almost touched her
      ear.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why are you so silent?&rdquo; he asked. &ldquo;Are you still afraid?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I was wondering what my mother will think,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &ldquo;She'll
      be sure we have been killed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't worry about that,&rdquo; Floyd said, cheerfully. &ldquo;I gave Pole my last
      match, or I'd take a smoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, Cynthia, you don't know when you are in luck. I feel like Providence
      is good to me. I've not really had you much to myself all the afternoon,
      <i>anyway</i>, along with the tiresome preaching, singing, shouting, and
      the fast riding in the dark, and now&mdash;&rdquo; He reached out and took her
      hand. She made an effort to withdraw it, but he laughed and held it
      firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't be afraid of me, dear,&rdquo; he said. And then, as in a flash, a picture
      stood before him. He saw Pole Baker at his rough bench kneeling in the
      straw. He had another vision. It was the gaunt farmer as he stalked
      forward to shake hands with the preacher. Then Floyd, as it were, stood
      facing the mountaineer, and, above the thunder of the raging tempest
      without, Pole's grim warning broke upon the ears of his soul. Floyd sat
      staring into the darkness. He saw a white dove fluttering in a grassy spot
      before a coiled snake, with eyes like living diamonds. A shudder passed
      over him, and raising Cynthia's hand to his lips he kissed it lightly,
      respectfully, and released it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Perhaps you'd rather have me stay near the door, little girl,&rdquo; he said,
      in a tone he had never used to her before. &ldquo;You were thrown here with me
      against your will, and I shall not force my attentions upon you. Don't be
      afraid. I'm going to the door and sit down. I can see the road from there,
      and as soon as the storm is over I'll come for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no response, and, rising, he moved away, taking an armful of the
      corn-blades with him. He found a place against the wall, near the door,
      and throwing the fodder down he rested upon it, his long legs stretched
      out upon the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Pole Baker has shot more manhood into my dirty
      carcass to-day than it ever held before. I'll take care of your little
      sister, Pole. She's a sweet, dear, noble, brave little woman. There is not
      another such a one on earth. Good God! what must a sensitive, refined
      creature like she is think of an affair like that Jeff Wade business?&rdquo; He
      shuddered. Pushing some of the fodder under his head, he reclined at full
      length. Something Pole had said to him once while they were on the
      river-bank fishing came to him. &ldquo;I believe,&rdquo; the mountaineer had said,
      with his eyes on his line, &ldquo;that the Almighty made women weak in their
      very sweetness an' purity an' men strong in evil. An' He lets two of 'em
      come together in this life, an' stand side by side, an' ef the man is good
      enough, they will grow together an' work fer good an' perfect happiness.
      But ef he's evil, he kin put out his slimy arms an' draw her into his own
      cesspool like a water-moccasin coiled round a pond-lily. It is with the
      man to make or damn his chances of contentment in life, an' when he's
      soaked in evil he not only damns hisse'f but all he touches.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd closed his eyes. His admiration for Pole Baker had never been so
      intense. For perhaps the first time in his life he felt the sting of the
      hot blood of shame in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll take care of your little sister, Pole,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll do it&mdash;I'll
      do it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He closed his eyes. The storm was beating more steadily now. His thoughts
      became a delicious blur.
    </p>
    <p>
      He was asleep. Several hours must have passed. He waked, sat up, and
      looked about him; it was not so dark now, and while it was still raining,
      the noise of the falling drops was not so loud. He stood up and stretched
      himself. From the stiffness of his limbs he knew he had slept a long time.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo; he called out, but there was no reply. &ldquo;Cynthia!&rdquo; he called
      again, but still only his own voice rang out above the falling rain and
      whistling wind. He groped forward. In the darkness he saw her white dress
      like a drift of snow against the pile of fodder. He bent over her and
      touched her. She sat up with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've been asleep, too,&rdquo; he laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, have I?&rdquo; she exclaimed. &ldquo;I&mdash;I&mdash;forgot where I was, and I
      was so tired. Is&mdash;is the rain over? Can we go on now?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not yet, I'm afraid, Cynthia,&rdquo; he said, consolingly. &ldquo;If you don't object
      to staying here alone, I'll go outside and look around. I want to see if
      we can cross the mill creek. Sometimes it gets very high.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I'm not afraid,&rdquo; she assured him. &ldquo;There's nothing here to be afraid
      of.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some women would imagine the mill was full of tramps or escaped negro
      convicts,&rdquo; he laughed, &ldquo;but you are different, little girl. You are
      plucky. I'll be back in a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He returned very soon, stamping his wet boots on the mill steps. &ldquo;The rain
      is about over,&rdquo; he told her. &ldquo;The sky in the east is clearing up; in fact,
      it is almost daybreak. Cynthia, we have both, slept longer than we had any
      idea of. But the worst part of the business is that the creek is out of
      its banks and we can't get across till it runs down; but that won't take
      long. We can start for home about sunrise, and then we can go like the
      wind. Jack will want his breakfast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She said nothing, but he fancied he heard her sigh. She started to rise
      and he put out his hand. She gave him hers with a strange, new show of
      confidence that touched him, thrilled him, and sent a flush of vague
      gratification over him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are disappointed,&rdquo; he said, tentatively. With her hand still in his
      they walked to the door and looked out towards the pale sky in the east.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was wondering what my mother will think,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;She won't like
      this at all. But you know, Nel&mdash;you know, Mr. Floyd, that I couldn't
      help it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course not,&rdquo; he said, frowning darkly. &ldquo;Stopping here really saved our
      lives. She'll have to see that. You can make her see it, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She's very peculiar,&rdquo; Cynthia sighed. &ldquo;The smallest things almost drive
      her insane. The rain is over; don't you think we could go some other way
      and avoid the creek?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, yes, we could drive back to the Hillcrest road, but it would take
      two hours longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, we would have to wait here that long wouldn't we?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's six of one and half a dozen of the other,&rdquo; he smiled. &ldquo;If you'd
      rather be in the buggy and on the move, why, we can start.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think I had,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; you are the doctor,&rdquo; he laughed. &ldquo;I'll get Jack out and have
      him hitched to the buggy in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE sun&mdash;and
      it had never seemed to shine so brightly before&mdash;had been up about
      half an hour when the couple drove up to Porter's gate.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's mother at the window now,&rdquo; Cynthia said, as she got out of the
      buggy. &ldquo;I can see that she's angry even from here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll hitch Jack and go in and explain,&rdquo; offered Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, don't!&rdquo; Cynthia said, quickly. &ldquo;I'll tell her all about it. Go on.
      Good-bye.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-bye, then,&rdquo; Floyd said, and he drove on to the village.
    </p>
    <p>
      But Mrs. Porter did not come to the door to meet her as Cynthia expected.
      The girl found her alone in the sitting-room seated sulkily at the
      fireplace, where a few sticks of damp wood were burning gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, where did you spend the night?&rdquo; the old woman asked, icily.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stood before her, withered to her soul by the tone in which her
      mother's question had been asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are not going to like it a bit, mother,&rdquo; the girl said, resignedly.
      &ldquo;The storm overtook us just as we got to Long's mill. The horse was
      frightened and about to run away and the road was awfully dangerous. There
      was nothing for us to do but to go in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Long's mill! Oh, my God! there is no one living there, nor in miles of
      it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it, mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter buried her pale, wrinkled face in her hands and leaned forward
      in her chair, her sharp elbows on her knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm never going to get over this!&rdquo; she groaned&mdash;&ldquo;never&mdash;never;
      and you are my <i>only</i> child!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother!&rdquo; Cynthia bent down and almost with anger drew the old woman's
      hand from her face. &ldquo;Do you know what you are saying? Do you know that&mdash;that
      you may drive me from home with that insinuation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter groaned. She got up stiffly, and, like a mechanical thing
      moved by springs, she caught her daughter's wrist and led her to a window,
      sternly staring at her from her great, sunken eyes. &ldquo;Do you mean to tell
      me that you and <i>that</i> man sat together all the live-long night in
      that mill?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, I was completely tired out. There was some fodder on the floor. I
      sat down on it, and after a long time I dropped asleep. He did too. He was
      near the door, and I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter extended the stiff fingers of her hand and plucked a piece of
      fodder from Cynthia's hair, and held it sneeringly up to the light. &ldquo;It's
      a pity you didn't have a comb and brush with you,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You'd have
      been supplied at a hotel. Your hair is all in a mess. I'm going to keep
      this little thing. Light as it is, it has knocked life and hope out of
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia looked at her steadily for a moment, and then turned from the
      room. &ldquo;I'm not going to defend myself against such suspicions as you
      have,&rdquo; she said from the door. &ldquo;I know what I am, if you don't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon this whole county will know what you are before many days,&rdquo;
       snarled Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;Minnie Wade had somebody in her family with enough
      manhood in 'im to want to defend her honor, but you haven't. Your
      sleepy-headed old father&mdash;&rdquo; The girl was gone. For several minutes
      the old woman stood quivering in the warm sunlight at the window, and then
      she stalked calmly through the dining-room and kitchen and out to the
      barn. One of the stable-doors was open, and she could see her husband
      inside.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan Porter!&rdquo; she called out&mdash;&ldquo;you come here. I've got something
      to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right,&rdquo; he answered. &ldquo;I'll be thar in a minute. Dern yore lazy soul,
      hain't I give you enough corn to eat without you havin' to chaw up a
      brand-new trough? I'm a good mind to take this curry-comb an' bust yore
      old head with it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan Porter, I say, come out here! Let that horse alone!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, I'm a-comin'. Now, I reckon I'll have to fetch a hammer an'
      saw an' nails an' buy planks to make another trough, jest fer you to chaw
      up into powder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan Porter, do you hear me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I reckon ef I don't, they do over at Baker's,&rdquo; and the farmer,
      bareheaded and without his coat, came from the stable.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That blasted hoss has deliberately set to work an' chaw&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nathan Porter&rdquo;&mdash;the old woman thrust her slim fingers into his face&mdash;&ldquo;do
      you see that piece of fodder?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I see it. Is it a sample o' last year's crop? Are you buy in' or
      sellin'? You mought 'a' fetched a bundle of it. A tiny scrap like&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got that out o' Cynthia's hair.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say! It must be a new sort o' ornament! I wouldn't be surprised
      to see a woman with a bundle of it under each arm on the front bench at
      meetin' after seein' them Wilson gals t'other night ready fer the dance
      with flour in the'r hair an' the ace o' spades pasted on the'r cheeks.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia and Nelson Floyd stayed all night in Long's mill,&rdquo; panted Mrs.
      Porter. &ldquo;There wasn't another soul there nor in miles of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, you don't say!&rdquo; the farmer sniffed. &ldquo;I reckon ef they had 'a' sent
      out a proclamation through the country that they was goin' to stay thar a
      lot o' folks would 'a' waded through the storm to be present.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I got this out of her hair, I tell you!&rdquo; the old woman went on, fiercely.
      &ldquo;Her head was all messed up, and so was her dress. If you've got any
      manhood in you, you'll go to town and call Nelson Floyd out and settle
      this thing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh! Me go to his store on his busiest day an' ax 'im about a piece o'
      fodder no bigger'n a gnat's wing? He'd tell me I was a dern fool, an' I'd
      deserve it. Oh! see what you are a-drivin' at, an' I tell you it gits me
      out o' patience. You women are so dad blasted suspicious an' guilty at the
      bottom yorese'ves that you imagine bad acts is as plentiful as the leaves
      on the ground in the fall. Now, let me tell you, you hain't obeying the
      Scriptural injunction to judge not lest ye be judged accordin'ly. I want
      you to let that little gal an' her sweetheart business alone. You hain't
      a-runnin' it. You don't have to live with the feller she picks out, an'
      you hain't no say whatever in the matter. Nur you h'aint got no say,
      nuther, as to the way she does her particular courtin'. The Lord knows,
      nobody was kind enough to put in away back thar when you was makin' sech a
      dead set fer me. Folks talk a little about Floyd, but let me tell you my
      <i>own</i> character them days wasn't as white as snow. I don't know many
      men wuth the'r salt that hain't met temptation. I sorter cut a wide swath
      'fore I left the turf, an' you know it. Didn't I hear you say once that
      you reckoned you never would 'a' tuck me ef I'd 'a' been after you day an'
      night? You knowed thar was other fish in the sea, an' you didn't have any
      bait to speak of, with them Turner gals an' the'r nigger slaves an'
      plantations in the'r own right livin' next door to pa's. Yore old daddy
      said out open that you an' yore sister needn't expect a dollar from him;
      he'd educated you, an' that was all he could do. I hain't grumblin', mind
      you. I never cry over spilt milk; it hain't sensible. It don't help a body
      out of a bad matter into a better one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wish you'd hush and listen to me.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter had not heard half
      he had said. &ldquo;I tell you Cynthia and that man stayed all night long in
      that lonely mill together, an' she came home at sunrise this morning all
      rumpled up and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, you stop right thar! <i>You stop right thar!</i>&rdquo; Porter said, with
      as much sternness as he could command. &ldquo;As to stayin' in that mill all by
      the'rse'ves, I want you jest to put on yore thinkin'-cap, ef the old thing
      hain't wore clean to tatters or laid away till it's moth-et. Do you
      remember when that lonely old widder Pelham pegged out durin' our
      courtin'-time? You do? <i>Well!</i> We went thar&mdash;you an' me did&mdash;expectin'
      to meet the Trabue crowd, an' that passle o' young folks from Hanson's, to
      set up with the corpse. Well, when me'n' you got thar about eight o'clock
      the Trabue crowd sent word that as long as the Hanson lay-out was comin',
      they believed they wouldn't drive so fur; an' right on top o' that come a
      message from the Hanson folks, sayin' that you an' me an' the Trabues was
      as many as the little house would hold, so they would stay away; an' thar
      you an' me was with nobody to make us behave but a dead woman, an' <i>her</i>
      screwed down tight in a box. I remember as clear as day that you laughed
      an' said you didn't care, an' you set in to makin' coffee an' cookin' eggs
      an' one thing another to keep us awake an' make me think you was handy
      about a house. Well, now, here's the moral to that tale. The neighbors&mdash;tough
      as my record was&mdash;was kind enough not to say nasty things about us
      afterwards, an' it hain't Christian or motherly of you to start a tale
      about our gal when as big a storm as that driv' her an' her beau in out o'
      danger. Besides, I tell you, you are standin' in Cynthia's light. She's
      got as good a right to the best in the land as anybody, an' I believe
      Nelson Floyd is goin' to git married sooner or later. He's had a chance to
      look over the field, an' I hope she'll suit 'im. I never made money by
      marryin', myself, an' I sorter like the idea o' my child gittin' a
      comfortable berth. That gal hain't no common person nohow. She'll show off
      a fine house as well as any woman in this state. She's got sense, an' a
      plenty of it; folks say she's like me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are talking about.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter was looking at
      the ground. Her hard face had softened; she was drawn perforce to words at
      her husband's view of the matter. His rebuke rang harshly in her ears. She
      turned towards the house and took several steps, then she looked back. &ldquo;I
      pray God you are right, Nathan,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;Maybe all the worry I had
      through the night has made me unable to see the matter fairly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's it!&rdquo; said Porter, as he leaned on the fence; &ldquo;and let me tell you,
      if you don't quit makin' so many mountains out o' mole-hills, an' worryin'
      at sech a rate, you'll go like yore sister Martha did. Try worryin' about
      <i>yorese'f</i> awhile; ef I thought as mean about my own child as you do
      I'd bother about the condition o' my soul.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With her head hanging low, Mrs. Porter walked slowly to the house. Her
      view was more charitable and clearer, though she was so constituted that
      she could not at once obey her inclination to apologize to her daughter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm actually afraid I'm losing my mind,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I am acting exactly
      as Sister Martha did.&rdquo;

      XVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was a warm
      morning on the first day of June. Pole Baker lay on the thick grass, near
      the door of the court-house, talking to Jim Carden, a little shoemaker
      from Darley.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Didn't Nelson Floyd go in the court-house jest now?&rdquo; Pole asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; said the shoemaker, in his high voice; &ldquo;him an' Colonel Price was
      settin' here fer half an' hour 'fore you come, talkin' about a trade.
      Price is tryin' to sell 'im his plantation, an' that big house completely
      furnished. I'd rather see Floyd's eyes when he's on a trade than anything
      I ever looked at. They shine like twin stars. But I don't believe they'll
      trade. They are too far apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This section is chock full o' keen men, from the highest to the lowest,&rdquo;
       remarked Pole. &ldquo;Old settlers say that a long time ago seven Jews settled
      here, intendin' to git rich, an' that these mountain men got all they had,
      an' the Jews literally starved to death. Thar hain't been one in the
      county since.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Our folks certainly are hard to down,&rdquo; said Carden. &ldquo;Do you know that
      long, slim chap in front o' Floyd's store? That's one o' the Bowen boys,
      from Gilmer&mdash;I mean the feller at the covered wagon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Know 'im? I reckon I do,&rdquo; Pole laughed, &ldquo;That's Alf Bowen. I had a round
      with 'im one day. It was in the fall o' the year, an' they was so busy at
      Mayhew &amp; Floyd's that they pulled me into service. I'm a purty good
      salesman when I'm about half loaded. Well, Alf come in leadin' his little
      gal by the hand, an' said he wanted to fit 'er out in a cloak. Joe Peters
      hung to 'im fer half an' hour, but everything he'd show the feller was too
      high, or not good enough, an Joe switched 'im off on me. Joe was afeard ef
      the skunk went out that some more that was with 'im would follow, an' <i>they</i>
      was buyin' a little, now an' then. Well, do you know, Jim, I made up my
      mind I'd sell that feller a cloak ef I had to do it below cost an' make up
      the difference myself. Old Uncle Abner Daniel was thar settin' on a
      nail-keg, a-spittin' an' a-chawin' an' pokin' fun at me. As I was passin'
      'im he cocked his eye up an' said, said he: 'Pole, I'll bet you a segar
      you cayn't sell 'im.' 'Done,' said I. 'I'll go you,' an' I set to work in
      earnest. Alf had sorter intimated that six dollars was his cloak-limit,
      an' I drawed Joe Peters round behind a stack o' boxes, an' axed 'im ef we
      had anything as low as that. Joe said no, we didn't, but, said he,
      'sometimes when we git short, we run into Glenn's store next door an' take
      out an' article on trial, an' ef we sell it, we git it at cost.' Well, I
      happened to know that Glenn had some cloaks in, so I went back to my
      customer an' told 'im that we had jest got in a box o' cloaks the day
      before, but they was in the cellar unopened, an' ef he'd wait a minute,
      I'd bust the box an' see ef thar was any low-priced cloaks in the lot.
      Bowen's eyes sorter danced, an' he said he had plenty o' time. So I picked
      up a hammer an' run down in the cellar. I knocked at an empty box, an'
      kicked over a barrel or two, an' then scooted out at the back door an'
      round into Glenn's shebang. 'Sam,' said I, 'have you got a cloak that you
      kin let us have so we kin sell it at six dollars an' make any profit?' He
      studied a minute, an' then he said he 'lowed he had jest the thing, an' he
      went an' got one an' fetched it to me. 'This un,' said he, 'is all right
      except this little ripped place here under the arm, but any woman kin fix
      that in a minute. I kin let you have it, Pole, fer five-fifty.' Well, sir,
      I grabbed it an' darted back into our cellar, knocked once or twice more
      with the hammer, an' run up to Alf an' the gal. 'Here's one,' said I.
      'It's an eight-dollar garment, but in drawin' it out o' the box jest now I
      ripped it a little, but any woman kin fix that in a minute. Now, bein' as
      it's <i>you</i>, Alf,' said I, 'an' we want yore trade, I'll make it to
      you at first cost without the freight from Baltimore. I kin give you this
      thing, Alf,' said I, fer six dollars.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, sir, I thought I had 'im, an' was winkin' at Uncle Ab, when Bowen
      sorter sniffed an' stuck his long finger through the hole. 'Shucks!' said
      he. 'Sam Glenn offered me that cloak fer four dollars an' a half two weeks
      ago. I could 'a' got it fer four, but I wouldn't have it. It's moth-et.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Carden threw himself back on the grass and laughed. &ldquo;What the devil did
      you do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do?&mdash;nothin'. What could I do? I jest grinned an' acknowledged the
      corn. The joke was agin me. An' the funny part of it was the feller was so
      dead in earnest he didn't see anything to laugh at. Ef I'd a-been in his
      place I'd 'a' hollered.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you give Uncle Ab his cigar?&rdquo; the shoemaker asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I offered it to 'im, Jim, but he wouldn't take it. I axed 'im why.
      'Beca'se,' said he, 'I was bettin' on a certainty.' 'How's that?' said I.
      'Why,' said he, 'I seed Alf Bowen buy a cloak fer that gal at the fire
      sale over at Darley two weeks ago. He was just lookin' around to see ef
      he'd got bit.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole saw Floyd coming out of the court-house and went to him. &ldquo;I
      understand you an' Price are on a deal,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, but we are far apart,&rdquo; Floyd answered, pleasantly. &ldquo;He offers me his
      entire two thousand acres and furnished house for twenty-five thousand. As
      I told him, Pole, I could draw the money out of other investments an' take
      the property, but I couldn't see profit in it above twenty thousand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's wuth all he asks fer it,&rdquo; Pole said, wisely.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know it is, to any man who wants to live on it, but if I buy it, I'd
      have to hire a good man to manage it, and, altogether, I can't see my way
      to put more than twenty thousand in it. He's anxious to sell. He and his
      wife want to move to Atlanta, to be with their married daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were walking towards Floyd's store, and Pole paused in the street.
      &ldquo;Are you busy right now, Nelson?&rdquo; he asked, his face wearing a serious
      look.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not at all, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I've got some'n' to say to you, Nelson. I'm goin' to acknowledge
      that thar's one thing I've wanted to do fer you more, by hunkey, than
      anything in the world. Nelson, I've always hoped that I'd run across some
      clew that 'ud eventually lead to you findin' out who yore kin are.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's good of you, Pole,&rdquo; responded Floyd, in a sincere tone. &ldquo;It is a
      thing I am more interested in than anything else in the world.&rdquo; The young
      merchant laughed mechanically. &ldquo;Pole, if the lowest-looking tramp you ever
      saw in your life were to come here, and I found out he was even a distant
      cousin of mine, I'd look on him with reverence. I'd fit him out in new
      clothes and give him money, and never want to lose sight of him. Why I
      feel that way I don't know, but it is planted deep down inside.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew you felt that away,&rdquo; said Pole, &ldquo;and, as I say, I want to help.
      Now, Nelson, all my life folks has said I was keen about tracin' things
      out. In my moonshinin' day, an' since then, in helpin' old Ab Daniel an'
      Alan Bishop in that timber deal, an' in one way an' another, I've always
      been good at readin' men an' the'r faces an' voices. Now, I reckon what
      Captain Duncan said that day about his talk with that feller Floyd&mdash;Henry
      A. Floyd&mdash;in Atlanta went in at one o' yore ears an' out at t'other,
      but it didn't with me. I've studied about that thing night an' day ever
      since, an' yesterday I had a talk with Duncan. I made 'im go over what him
      an' Floyd said, word fer word, an' I'm here to tell you that I want yore
      consent to see that old man myself. I've got to go down to the United
      States court to-morrow to see Judge Spence, about leniency in old Paxton's
      moonshine case, an' I'll have time on my hands. I wish you'd consent to
      let me talk, in a roundabout way, of course, to that man Floyd. Captain
      Duncan made a big mistake in sayin' so much about yore bad luck in yore
      childhood an' nothin' about what you've since made of yourself. A man as
      pore as Floyd is, an' as proud, wouldn't care to rake up kin with a man
      like Duncan showed you to be. The captain had an idea that ef he got the
      old chap's pity up he'd find out what he wanted to know, but a man of that
      stripe don't pity no unfortunate man nor want to claim kin with 'im. From
      the way Duncan talked to me, I have an idea that old man was keepin' back
      some'n'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd was looking at his rough friend with eyes full of emotion. &ldquo;I'd
      rather have you do a thing of that kind, Pole, than any man alive,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;And I can trust your judgment and tact, too. I confess I am not
      hopeful in that particular direction, but if you want to see the man, why,
      do it. I certainly appreciate your interest, and next time I hope you will
      not wait to ask my consent. I trust the whole matter to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; the mountaineer smiled, &ldquo;I may be away off in my calculations, and
      make nothin' by it, but I want to try my hand. Thar comes Colonel Price.
      I'll bet a new hat he'll come to yore offer before long. You jest keep a
      stiff upper lip, an' don't bring up the subject of yore own accord; he'll
      do the talkin'.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN he had
      finished his interview with Judge Spence in Atlanta the next day, Pole
      went to a drug-store and looked up the address of Henry A. Floyd in the
      city directory. The old bachelor lived on Peachtree Street, about half a
      mile from the Union Depot, in a rather antiquated story-and-a-half frame
      house, which must have been built before the Civil War. The once white
      paint on its outside had turned to a weather-beaten gray, and the
      old-fashioned blinds, originally bright green in color, had faded, and
      hung loosely on rusty hinges. There was a little lawn in front which
      stretched from the gateless iron fence to the low-floored veranda, but it
      held scarcely a tuft of grass, the ground being bare in some places and in
      others weed-grown. Pole went to the door and rang. He was kept waiting for
      several minutes before a middle-aged woman, evidently a servant of all
      work or house-keeper, appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Is Mr. Floyd about?&rdquo; Pole asked, politely, doffing his slouch hat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's back in the garden behind the house,&rdquo; the woman said. &ldquo;If you'll
      wait here I'll go call him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, ma'am,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;I'll wait; I've got plenty o' time.&rdquo; She
      went away, and he sat down on a rickety bench on the veranda, his hat
      still in his hands, his eyes on the passing carriages and street-cars.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently the owner of the house appeared round the corner. He was tall,
      clerical looking, ashy as to complexion, slightly bald, had sunken cheeks
      over which grew thin, iron-gray side-whiskers, and a despondent stoop.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll have to git at that old skunk through his pocket,&rdquo; Pole reflected,
      as his keen eyes took in every detail of the man's make-up. &ldquo;He looks like
      he's bothered about some'n', an' a man like that's hard to git pinned
      down; an' ef I don't git 'im interested, he'll kick me out o' this yard.
      I'll be derned ef he don't favor Nelson a little about the head an' eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How are you, Mr. Floyd?&rdquo; Pole stood up and extended his hand. &ldquo;Baker's my
      name, sir; from up the country. I was on yore farm in Bartow not long ago,
      an' I sorter liked the lay o' the land. Bein' as I was down here on
      business, anyhow, I 'lowed I'd drap in an' ax ef you had any part o' that
      place you'd care to rent. I've jest got two hosses, but I want to put in
      about thirty acres.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A slight touch of life seemed to struggle into the wan face of the old man
      for a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got just about that many acres unrented,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;The rest is all
      let out. You'd have good neighbors, Mr.&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Baker, sir&mdash;Pole Baker,&rdquo; the caller put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And good fertile land, too, Mr. Baker. May I ask if you intend to rent on
      the part-crop plan or for cash?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole's eyes twinkled as they rested on a pair of fine horses and
      glittering carriage that were passing. &ldquo;Ef I rent <i>yore'n</i>, Mr.
      Floyd, I'll pay cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, that certainly is the wisest plan, Mr. Baker.&rdquo; There was a still
      greater show of life in the old man's face; in fact, he almost smiled.
      &ldquo;Come inside a minute. I've got a map of my property, showing just how
      each section lies and how it's drained and watered.&rdquo; He opened the door
      and led Pole into a wide hall, and thence, to the right, into a big,
      bare-looking parlor. &ldquo;Have a seat, Mr. Baker; my desk is in the little
      room adjoining.&rdquo; Pole sat down, crossed his long legs, and put his hat on
      his knee. When he found himself alone he smiled. &ldquo;Captain Duncan thought a
      crabbed old cuss like that 'ud be interested in pore kin,&rdquo; he mused. &ldquo;Huh!
      nothin' short o' Vanderbilts an' Jay Goulds 'ud start his family pulse to
      beatin'. Le' me see, now, how I'd better begin to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is, Mr. Baker.&rdquo; Floyd entered with a map and pencil in his hand.
      &ldquo;If you looked the place over when you were there, you may remember that
      the creek winds round from the bridge to the foot of the hill. Well, right
      in there&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, and that's dandy land, Mr. Floyd,&rdquo; Pole broke in. &ldquo;That's as good
      as you got, I reckon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very best, Mr. Baker&mdash;in fact, it's the part I always rent for
      cash. I have to have ready money for taxes and interest and the like, you
      know, and when I strike a man who is able to pay in advance, why, I can
      make him a reasonable figure, and he gets the best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's got a good house on it, too, I believe?&rdquo; Pole was stroking his chin
      with a thoughtful air.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Six rooms, and a well and stable and good cow-house, Mr. Baker.&rdquo; Old
      Floyd was actually beaming.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does the roof leak?&rdquo; Pole looked at him frankly. &ldquo;I won't take my wife
      and children into a leaky house, Mr. Floyd. If I pay out my money, I want
      ordinary comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doesn't leak a drop, Mr. Baker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole stroked his chin for another minute. He was looking down at the worn
      carpet, but he felt Floyd's eyes fastened eagerly on him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what's yore figure, Mr. Floyd?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Two hundred dollars a year&mdash;half when you move in, and the rest a
      month later.&rdquo; The old man seemed to hold his breath. The paper which he
      was folding quivered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I wouldn't kick about the price,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;The only thing that&mdash;&rdquo;
       Pole seemed to hesitate for a moment, then he went on. &ldquo;I never like to
      act in a hurry in important business matters, an' I generally want to be
      sorter acquainted with a man I deal with. You see, ef I moved on that
      place it 'ud be to stay a long time, an' thar'd be things on <i>yore</i>
      side to do year after year. I generally ax fer references, but I'm a-goin'
      to be straight with you, Mr. Floyd; somehow, I feel all right about you. I
      like yore face. The truth is, you have a strong favor to a feller up our
      way. He's the richest young man we got, an' the finest ever God's sun
      shone on. An' as soon as I heard yore name was Floyd&mdash;the same as his
      is&mdash;somehow I felt like you an' him was kin, an' that I wouldn't lose
      by dealin' with you. Blood will tell, you know.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, who do you mean?&rdquo; The old man stared in pleased surprise. &ldquo;All the
      Floyds I know were broken up by the war. I must say none of them are
      really rich.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This Floyd is, you kin bet yore boots on that,&rdquo; Pole said,
      enthusiastically. &ldquo;He owns mighty nigh the whole o' our county; he's the
      biggest moneylender and investor in stocks and bonds I know of. He's fine
      all round: he'd fight a buzz-saw barehanded; he's got more friends than
      you kin shake a stick at; he could walk into Congress any election ef he'd
      jest pass the word out that he wanted the job.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, this is certainly news to me,&rdquo; the old man said. &ldquo;And you say he
      resembles me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got yore eyes to a T, an' long, slim hands like yore'n, an' the same
      shape o' the head an' neck! Why, shorely you've heard o' Nelson Floyd,
      junior member o' Mayhew &amp; Floyd, of Springtown, the biggest dealers o'
      farm supplies in&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nelson Floyd! Why&mdash;why, surely there must be some mistake. He
      hasn't made money, has he? Why, the only time I ever heard of him he was
      in destitute circumstances, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Destitute hell!&mdash;I beg yore pardon, Mr. Floyd, that slipped out. But
      that feller's not only not destitute, but he's the <i>friend</i> o' the
      destitute. What he does fer the pore an' sufferin' every year 'ud start
      many a man in life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A flush had crept into Floyd's face, and he leaned forward in warm
      eagerness. &ldquo;The truth is, Mr. Baker, that Nelson Floyd is the only child
      of all the brother I ever had.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You <i>don't say!</i>&rdquo; exclaimed Pole, holding the old man's eyes firmly,
      &ldquo;which brother was that?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Charles Nelson&mdash;two years younger than I am. The truth is, he and I
      became estranged. He broke my mother's heart, Mr. Baker. He was very wild
      and dissipated, though he died bravely in battle. I would have looked
      after his son, but I lost sight of him and his mother after the war, and,
      then, I had my own troubles. There are circumstances, too, which I don't
      care to go over with a&mdash;a stranger. But I'm glad the young man has
      done well. The first I heard of him was about ten years ago. He was then
      said to be a sort of wild mountain outlaw. It was not natural for me to
      feel pride in him, or&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He <i>was</i> wild about that time,&rdquo; Pole said, as he stood up to go,
      &ldquo;but he settled down and made a man of hisse'f. I'll let you know about
      that land, Mr. Floyd. Ef you don't hear from me by&mdash;this is Tuesday,
      ain't it?&mdash;ef you don't hear from me by Saturday, you may know that
      my wife has decided to stay on up the country.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd's face had fallen&mdash;&ldquo;I hope nothing won't interfere
      with our deal, Baker. I'd like to have you on my place. I really would.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, we'll live in hopes,&rdquo; said the mountaineer, &ldquo;ef we die in
      despair,&rdquo; and Pole went out into the sunlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, Poley,&rdquo; he chuckled, &ldquo;who said you couldn't git all you was after?
      But <i>lie!</i> My Lord, I don't know when I'll ever git all that out o'
      my body. I feel like I am literally soaked in black falsehood, like a hide
      in a vat at a tanyard. It's leakin' out o' the pores o' my skin an'
      runnin' down into my socks. But that dried-up old skunk made me do it. Ef
      he hadn't a-been so 'feared o' pore kin, I wouldn't 'a' had to sink so
      low. Well, I've got news fer Nelson, an' that's what I was after.&rdquo;

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was ten o'clock
      that night when the stage, or &ldquo;hack,&rdquo; as it was called, put Pole down in
      the square at Springtown. He went directly to Floyd's store, hoping to see
      the young man before he went to bed, but the long building was wrapped in
      darkness. Pole went over to the little hotel where Floyd roomed. The
      proprietor, Jerry Malone, and two tobacco drummers sat smoking on the
      veranda.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's jest this minute gone up to his room,&rdquo; the landlord said, in
      response to Baker's inquiry as to the whereabouts of his friend. &ldquo;It's the
      fust door to the right, at the top o' the steps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole went up and knocked on Floyd's door, and the young merchant called
      out, &ldquo;Come in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Baker opened the door, finding the room in darkness. From the bed in the
      corner Floyd's voice came: &ldquo;Is that you, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I jest got back, Nelson. I went to the store expectin' to find you
      at work, an' then Jerry told me you was up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Light the lamp, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;There are some matches on that table
      right under your hand.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I hain't got long to stay,&rdquo; returned the mountaineer, &ldquo;an' I don't
      need a light to talk by, any more'n a blind man does to write his letters.
      I 'lowed I'd tell you what I done down thar. I seed Floyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you did! After you left I got really interested in your venture, and
      I was afraid you might accidentally miss him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I seed 'im.&rdquo; Pole found a chair and sat down at the little table,
      resting his hand on it, and tilting the chair back, after his favorite
      method of making himself comfortable. There was a lamp on a post in front
      of the hotel and its light came through a window and faintly illuminated
      the room. Pole could see the white covering of Floyd's bed and the outline
      of the young man's head and shoulders against a big feather pillow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you saw him?&rdquo; Floyd's voice was eager and restrained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' I got news fer you, Nelson&mdash;substantial news. Henry A.
      Floyd is yore own uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Pole!&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd sat up in bed&mdash;&ldquo;don't make any
      mistakes. You say he is actually&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I ain't makin' no mistakes,&rdquo; replied Pole. &ldquo;He's the only brother of yore
      daddy, Charles Nelson Floyd. That old cuss told me so, an' I know he was
      tellin' me a straight tale.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Floyd pulled his feet from beneath the coverings and
      sat up on the bedside. He seemed unable to speak, and, leaning forward in
      his chair, the ex-moonshiner recounted in careful detail all that had
      passed between him and the man he had visited. For several minutes after
      Pole had concluded the merchant sat without visible movement, then Pole
      heard him take a long, deep breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope you are satisfied with what I done,&rdquo; said Pole, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Satisfied! Great Heavens!&rdquo; cried Floyd,' &ldquo;I simply don't know what to say
      to it&mdash;how to tell you what I feel. Pole, I'll bet I'm having the
      oddest experience that ever came to mortal man. I don't know how to
      explain it, or make you understand. When a baby's born it's too young to
      wonder or reflect over its advent into the world, but to-night, after all
      my years of life, I feel&mdash;Pole, I feel somehow as if I were suddenly
      born again. That dark spot on my history has been in my mind almost night
      and day ever since I was old enough to compare myself to others. Persons
      who have strong physical defects are often morbidly sensitive over them.
      That flaw in my life was my eternally sore point. And my mother&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd's
      voice sank reverently&mdash;&ldquo;did he say who she was?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, we didn't git fur enough,&rdquo; Pole returned. &ldquo;You see, Nelson, I got
      that information by pretendin' to be sorter indifferent about you, an' ef
      I'd 'a' axed too many questions, the old codger 'ud 'a' suspicioned my
      game. Besides, as I told you, he wasn't willin' to talk perfectly free.
      Although yore daddy's in the grave, the old man seems to still bear a sort
      o' grudge agin 'im, an' that, in my opinion, accounts fer him not helpin'
      you out when you was a child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; said Floyd; &ldquo;my father was wild as a young man?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's the way he put it,&rdquo; answered Baker; &ldquo;but I wouldn't let that
      bother me, Nelson. Ef yore daddy'd 'a' lived longer, no doubt, he'd 'a'
      settled down like you have. But he passed away in a good cause. It ort to
      be a comfort to know he died in battle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's a comfort,&rdquo; said Floyd, thoughtfully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' now you've got plenty o' kin,&rdquo; Pole said, with a pleasant laugh. &ldquo;I
      come over in the hack with Colonel Price and Captain Duncan, an' you ort
      to 'a' heard 'em both spout about the Floyds an' the Nelsons. They say
      yore blood's as blue as indigo, my boy, an' that they suspected it all
      along, on account o' yore pluck and determination to win in ever' game you
      tackled. Lord, you bet they'll be round to-morrow to give you the hand o'
      good-fellowship an' welcome you into high life. I reckon you'll sorter cut
      yore mountain scrub friends.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I haven't any scrub friends,&rdquo; said Floyd, with feeling. &ldquo;I don't know
      that you boast of your ancestry, Pole, but you are as high above the kind
      of man that does as the stars are above the earth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are a-kiddin' me!&rdquo; said Baker. He put out his hand on the table
      and felt something smooth and cool under his touch. He drew it to him. It
      was a pint flask filled with whiskey. He held it up with a laugh. &ldquo;Good
      Lord, what are you doin' with this bug-juice?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you mean that bottle of rye,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;I've kept that for a
      memento of the day I swore off, Pole, five years ago. I thought as long as
      I could pass it day after day and never want to uncork it, that it was a
      sign I was safely anchored to sobriety.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a little squeak like that of a frightened mouse. Pole had
      twisted the cork out and was holding the neck of the bottle to his nose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whiz!&rdquo; he exclaimed. &ldquo;That stuff smells <i>fine!</i> You say it's
      five years old, Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's almost old enough to vote,&rdquo; Floyd laughed. &ldquo;It was very old and
      mellow when I got it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The cork squeaked again Pole had stopped the bottle. It lay flat under his
      big, pulsating hand. His fingers played over it caressingly. &ldquo;I wouldn't
      advise you to keep it under yore eye all the time, Nelson,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I
      tried that dodge once an' it got the best o' my determination.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I sometimes feel the old desire come over me,&rdquo; said Floyd; &ldquo;often when my
      mind is at rest after work, and even while I am at it, but it is never
      here in my room in the presence of that memento. It seems to make a man of
      me. I pity a drinking man, Pole. I know what he has to fight, and I feel
      now that if I were to lose all hope in life that I'd take to liquor as
      naturally as a starving man would to food.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon,&rdquo; said Pole, in a strange, stilled voice. His fingers were now
      tightly clasped about the bottle. There was a pause, then he slid it
      cautiously&mdash;very cautiously&mdash;towards him. He swallowed something
      that was in his throat; his eyes were fixed in a great, helpless stare on
      the dim figure across the room. Noiselessly the bottle was raised, and
      noiselessly it went down into the pocket of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I feel like I owe you my life, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd continued, earnestly. &ldquo;You've
      done to-day what no one else could have done. If that old man had died
      without speaking of this matter I'd perhaps never have known the truth.
      Pole, you can call on me for anything you want that is in my power to
      give. Do you understand me, Pole, old friend?&mdash;anything&mdash;anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Pole sat staring vacantly in front of him. Floyd rose
      in slow surprise and came across the room. Pole stood up suddenly, his
      hand on the weighty pocket. Quickly he shifted to a darker portion of the
      room nearer the door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Pole?&rdquo; Floyd asked, in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Matter? Why, nothin', Nelson.&rdquo; Baker laughed mechanically. &ldquo;I was jest
      thinkin' that I ought to be in bed. I've told you all I kin, I guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You were so quiet just now that I thought&mdash;really, I didn't know
      what to think. I was telling you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, Nelson.&rdquo; Baker's unsteady hand was on the latch of the door.
      &ldquo;Never you mind, I'll call on you if I want anything. I've got yore
      friendship, I reckon, an' that's enough fer me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He opened the door and glided out into the hall. &ldquo;Good-night, Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good-night, Pole, good-night. God bless you, old man!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      On the lonely road leading to his house the mountaineer stopped and drew
      the bottle from his pocket. &ldquo;You dem little devil!&rdquo; he said, playfully,
      holding it up before his eyes in the starlight. &ldquo;Here I've gone all day in
      Atlanta, passin' ten 'thousand barroom doors, swearin' by all that was
      holy that I'd fetch Nelson Floyd his news with a sober head on my
      shoulders an' a steady tongue <i>in</i> that head; an' I rid, too, by
      hunkey, all the way from Darley out here with a hack-driver smellin' like
      a bung-hole, with two quarts under his seat an' no tellin' how many under
      his hide. I say I got through all that, although my jaws was achin' tell
      they felt like they was loose at the sockets, an' I 'lowed I'd slide safe
      to the home-base, when <i>you</i>&mdash;you crawled up under my nose in
      the dark like a yaller lizard, with that dern tale about yore ripe old age
      an' kingly flavor. '<i>Memento</i>' hell!&rdquo; Pole was using Floyd's word for
      the first time. &ldquo;I'd like to know what sort of a memento you'd make
      outside of a man's stomach. No, Poley, I reckon you've reached yore
      limit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mouse squeaked again. Pole chuckled. He held the flask aloft and shook
      it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gentlemen,&rdquo; he said to the countless stars winking merrily down from
      above, &ldquo;take one with me,&rdquo; and he drank.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>WO days after
      this, Nathan Porter brought home the news of what had happened to Floyd.
      The family were seated at the dinner-table when he came in warm from his
      walk along the dusty road. He started to sit down in his place without his
      coat, but Cynthia rose and insisted on his donning it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Folks is sech eternal fools!&rdquo; he said, as he helped his plate to a green
      hillock of string-beans, from the sides of which protruded bowlders of
      gray bacon, and down which ran rivulets of grease.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What have they been doing now?&rdquo; asked his wife, curiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They hain't doin' nothin' in town but talkin',&rdquo; Porter said, in a tone of
      disgust. &ldquo;Looks like all business has come to a dead halt, so that
      everybody kin exchange views about what Nelson Floyd has discovered about
      his kin. He's found a man&mdash;or Pole Baker did fer 'im, when Pole was
      drunk down in Atlanta&mdash;who don't deny he's his uncle&mdash;his
      daddy's own brother&mdash;an' you'd think Floyd had unearthed a gold-mine,
      from all the talk an' well-wishin' among the elect. Old Duncan an' Colonel
      Price helt a whole crowd spellbound at the post-office this mornin' with
      the'r tales about the past power an' grandeur of the Nelson an' Floyd
      families in America, an' all they'd done fer the'r country an' the like.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Father, is this true?&rdquo; Cynthia asked, her face almost pale in suppressed
      excitement.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon thar's no doubt about it,&rdquo; answered Porter. &ldquo;Pole Baker's
      roarin' drunk, an' that always indicates that some'n' good or bad's
      happened to him or his friends. Thar hain't no money in Floyd's find. The
      Atlanta man's on the ragged edge; in fact, some say he never would 'a'
      confessed to the crime ef he hadn't heard that Nelson was well-to-do. I
      dunno. I hardly ever laugh, but I mighty nigh split my sides while Jim
      Carden was pokin' fun at 'em all. Jim says all the bon-tons in this
      section has been treatin' Floyd like a runt pig till now. The Duncans had
      a big blow-out at the'r house last night. Miss Evelyn's got some Atlanta
      gals an' boys thar at a house-party, an' the shindig was a big event. Jim
      said he was standin' nigh Floyd yesterday when he got his invite, an' that
      Nelson was about to refuse p'int-blank to go, beca'se he'd never been axed
      thar before he got his blood certificate; but Jim said Pole Baker was
      standin' thar about half-shot, swayin' back an' forth agin the desk, an'
      Pole up an' told Floyd that he'd have to accept&mdash;that he was as good
      as any in the land, an' to refuse a thing o' that sort would belittle 'im;
      an' so Nelson put on a b'iled shirt an' a dicky cravat an' went. Jim said
      his wife run over with a passle o' other women to help about the
      dinin'-room an' kitchen, an' that Floyd was the high-cockalorum of the
      whole bunch. He said all the women was at his heels, an' that nothin' was
      talked except the high an' mighty grandeur that's come an' gone among the
      Nelsons an' Floyds. Jim said Floyd looked like he wanted to crawl through
      a knot-hole in the floor. I'll say this fer that feller&mdash;blood or no
      blood, he hain't no dem fool, an' you mark my words, this thing hain't
      a-goin' to spile 'im nuther. You let a man make hisse'f in life, an' he
      hain't a-goin' daft about the flabby, ready-made sort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wait and see,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, a sneer on her lips, as she
      critically eyed Cynthia's face. &ldquo;A man that's as bad as he is, to begin
      with, will be worse when he is run after like that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I dunno,&rdquo; said Porter, his mouth full of beans. &ldquo;I seed 'im give old
      Johnson Blare a cut this mornin' that tickled me powerful. The old skunk
      got out o' his rickety buggy in front o' the store an' went in to
      congratulate Floyd. I knowed what he was up to, an' follered 'im back to
      the desk. He told Floyd that he was a sort o' far-off cousin o' the
      Nelsons, an' that he was prouder of that fact than anything else in the
      world. I seed Floyd was mad as he looked at the old fellow with his high
      collar an' frazzley necktie. 'I'm gittin' tired o' the whole business,'
      Floyd said to 'im. 'I want to be appreciated, if I deserve it, for my <i>own</i>
      sake, an' not on account o' my dead kinsfolk.' An' that certainly did
      squelch old Blare. He shook all over when he went out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I suppose Nelson Floyd will end up by marrying Evelyn Duncan or some of
      the Prices,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, significantly, as she fastened her lynx eye
      on Cynthia's shrinking face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That seems to be the talk, anyway,&rdquo; Porter admitted. &ldquo;She belongs to the
      doll-faced, bandbox variety. She'd be a nice little trick to dandle on a
      fellow's knee, but that's about all she'd be good for.&rdquo; After the meal was
      over, Mrs. Porter followed Cynthia out into the kitchen, whither the girl
      was taking a big pan full of soiled dishes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;This ought to make you very careful, Cynthia,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know what you mean, mother.&rdquo; The girl looked up coldly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, <i>I</i> know what I mean,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;People seem to think
      this will bring about a sort of change in Nelson Floyd's way of living. We
      are really as good as anybody in this county, but we are poor, and others
      are rich, and have more social advantages. Evelyn Duncan always has
      snubbed you girls around here, and no young man has been going in both
      sets. So far nobody that I know of has talked unkindly about you and
      Nelson Floyd, but they would be more apt to now than ever. How that thing
      about the mill ever escaped&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, don't bring that up again!&rdquo; Cynthia said, almost fiercely. &ldquo;I
      have heard enough of it. I can't stand any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you know what I mean, and you have my warning,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter,
      sternly, &ldquo;and that's all I can do. As good and respectable a young man as
      ever lived wants to marry you, and the worst rake in the county has been
      paying you questionable attentions. The first thing you know, Mr.
      Hillhouse will get disgusted, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But Cynthia had left her work and gone out into the yard. With a face
      quite pale and set, she went through the orchard, climbed over the
      brier-grown rail-fence, and crossed the field and pasture to Pole Baker's
      house. Mrs. Baker, pale and bedraggled, with a ten-months-old baby on her
      arm, stood on the little porch of the cottage. At her feet the other
      children were playing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've heard o' my trouble, I kin see that,&rdquo; the married woman said, as
      the girl opened the gate. &ldquo;Come in out o' the sun.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've heard,&rdquo; said Cynthia, &ldquo;and I came as soon as I could.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They went into the poorly furnished bedroom, with its bare floor
      belittered with the playthings of the children, and sat down in the
      straight-backed, rockerless chairs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mustn't notice the way things look,&rdquo; sighed Mrs. Baker. &ldquo;The truth
      is, Cynthia, I haven't had the heart to lay my hand to a thing. Pole's
      been away three nights and three days now, and I don't know what has
      happened to him. He's quick tempered and gets into quarrels when he's
      drinkin'. He may be in jail in Darley, or away off some'rs on the
      railroad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know, I know,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;Let me hold the baby; you look as if you
      are about to drop.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't sleep an hour last night,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baker, as she relinquished
      the child. &ldquo;I don't want to complain. He's so good-hearted, Cynthia, and
      he can't help it to save his life. He's the kindest, sweetest man in the
      world when he's all right; but these sprees mighty nigh kill me. Take my
      advice an' don't marry a drinkin' man fer all you do. No&mdash;no, not
      even if you love 'im! It's easier to tear one out o' your heart before you
      have children by 'im, an' God knows a pore woman ought to have <i>some</i>
      happiness and peace of mind. If Pole don't come home to-day I'm afraid
      I'll go crazy. Pore little Billy kept wakin' up last night and askin'
      about his papa. He can't understand. He fairly worships his father.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We must hope for the best,&rdquo; Cynthia said, sympathetically, and she drew
      the baby up close to her face and kissed it tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Late in the afternoon Cynthia went home. She helped her mother prepare
      supper, and after it was over she followed the example of the others and
      retired to her room. For an hour she sat sewing at her table, every now
      and then stifling a sigh. She rose and looked out of her window, at the
      wing of the house on the left. It was dark; the family were already
      asleep. She would undress and go to bed, but she knew she would lie awake
      for a long time, and that she dreaded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then a sound broke the stillness of the night. Ah, she knew it so
      well! She sank back into her chair, quivering from head to foot in
      excitement. It was the whippoorwill call. It came again, more insistent,
      more pleading, but Cynthia sat motionless. Again it came; this time it was
      as if the weird notes were full of aggrieved inquiry. What was the matter?
      Why was she delaying? Cynthia rose, moved to the door of her room, but
      with her hand on the latch she paused. Then she turned back to her table
      and blew out her light, and began to disrobe in the darkness. No, she
      would not go in that manner to him again&mdash;never&mdash;never! To
      expect such a thing of Evelyn Duncan would not have entered his mind. Her
      mother was right. Evelyn Duncan was one thing in his estimation&mdash;she
      another. In the darkness she got into bed and drew the covering over her
      head that she might shut out the sound, for it pained her. There was
      silence for several minutes, then she heard the night bird's call farther
      away in the direction of the swamp. Floyd was going home. For hours she
      lay awake, unable to sleep. Once she sat upright with a start. Perhaps
      that would be the end. Perhaps she had driven him away, when if only she
      had obeyed the promptings of her heart he and she might&mdash;but he was
      gone, and, according to her mother's cautious view, she had acted for the
      best; and yet how could she ever forget the vast respect with which he had
      treated her that night at the mill? If he had been a bad man he would have
      shown it then. But he wasn't; he was good and thoughtful of her feelings.
      And he had come to-night full of his recent discovery. He wanted to tell
      her all about it, as he had told her of other things touching his inner
      life, and she had repulsed him&mdash;driven him away&mdash;to Evelyn
      Duncan. A sob struggled up in her bosom and forced its way to the surface.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> WEEK later Pole
      Baker came back from Darley on foot. He was covered with dust, his
      clothing was soiled and torn, his hair unkempt. He looked thinner; his big
      eyes seemed to burn in their sockets as if fed by the slow oil of despair.
      He paused at the well at the court-house to get a drink of water. He drank
      copiously from the big wooden bucket, and wiped his mouth on the back of
      his dusty hand. It was a very quiet afternoon at Springtown; scarcely any
      one was in sight. Pole moved over to the steps of the public building and
      sat down in abject indecision. &ldquo;The Lord knows I ort to go on home to
      Sally an' the childem,&rdquo; he groaned, &ldquo;but how kin I?&mdash;how kin I?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He sat there for half an hour, his head hanging, his great hands twitching
      nervously. Presently a shadow fell on the ground before him, and, looking
      up, he saw a negro boy extending a letter to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man told me ter give you dis here, Mr. Baker,&rdquo; the boy said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What man?&rdquo; Pole asked, as he took the communication.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't know 'im, suh. I never seed 'im before. He looked ter me like a
      mountain man. He was ridin' a little white mule, an' as soon as he gimme
      de letter an' tol me whar you was a settin' he whipped his mule an' rid
      off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole held the letter in his hand till the boy had gone, then he tore the
      envelope open and read it. It slipped from his inert fingers to the
      ground, and Pole, with glaring eyes, picked it up and read it again and
      again. To him it was worse than a death-blow.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Pole Baker,&rdquo; it began; &ldquo;we, the Mountain-side White Cap Association,
      beg leave to inform you that we have sat in council at three separate
      meetings on your case of protracted drunkenness and family neglect. If any
      other man in the county had done as you have, he would have met with
      punishment long ago, but your friends put in excuses for you and postponed
      it. However, we met again last night and decided that it was our duty to
      act in your case. For ten days now your wife, a sweet, patient woman, has
      been verging on to despair through you. We hold that no living man has a
      right to tie a good woman to him by cords of love and pity and then
      torture her on the rack night and day just to gratify a beastly appetite.
      This step is being taken with great regret, and by men not known to you,
      but who admire you in many ways and like you. Punishment has been dealt
      out here in the mountains to good effect, as you yourself have been heard
      to admit, and we confidently believe that after we have acted in your case
      you will be a better man to them that are dependent on you. To-night at
      eight o'clock sharp our body will be at the gum spring, half-way between
      your farm and the court-house. If you are there to meet us, the
      disagreeable matter of whipping you will be done there, out of sight and
      hearing of your wife and children; if not, we will have to do as we have
      done in the case of other men, go to your house and take you out. We
      earnestly hope you will meet us, and that you will be prepared to make us
      promises that you will keep.</i>

     </p>
    <p>
      Pole stared at the ground for a long time; the veins of his neck and brow
      stood out as if from physical torture. He looked about him suddenly in a
      spasm of effort to think of some escape from his impending doom. There was
      Nelson Floyd. He would grant him any request. He could draw upon the young
      merchant for unlimited funds, and before the fated hour arrived he could
      be far away from the country and his wife and children. A great lump rose
      inside of him and tore itself outward through his throat. No, he couldn't
      leave them; it was further out of his power now than ever. Besides, had he
      not brought all this on himself? Was not the threatened punishment equally
      as just in his case as it had been in the case of others among his
      neighbors? He rose to his feet. There was nothing left for him to do but
      to go home, and&mdash;yes, meet the White Caps at the appointed place and
      take what was coming to him bravely. Shoot? Defend his rights? Kill the
      men who were taking the part of those he himself had sworn to love and
      stand by?&mdash;no! The punishment?&mdash;yes; but after that, to his
      confused brain, all was a painful blank. His wife and children had always
      comforted him in trouble, but could they do so now? Would not the sight of
      their anxious faces only add to his load of remorse? As he went along the
      road towards his home, his rugged breast rose and expanded under his
      ragged shirt and then slowly fell. He was a dead man alive&mdash;a
      breathing, rotting horror in his own sight. A shudder went over him; he
      heard the commanding voice of the leader of the outlaws; he felt the lash
      and braced himself for another blow, which he hoped would cut deep enough
      to pierce the festering agony within him. Then his lower lip began to
      quiver, and tears came into his great, glaring eyes. He was beginning to
      pity himself, for, when all had been said and done, could he really have
      acted differently? Had God actually given him the moral and physical
      strength to avoid the pits into which he had stumbled with the
      helplessness of a little child?
    </p>
    <p>
      The road led him into the depths of a wood where the boughs of mighty
      trees arched overhead and obscured the sunlit sky. He envied a squirrel
      bounding unhindered to its nest. Nature seemed to hold out her vast,
      soothing arms to him. He wanted to sink into them and sob out his pent-up
      agony. In the deepest part of the wood, where rugged cliffs bordered the
      road, he came to the spring mentioned in the letter. Here he paused and
      looked about him. On this spot the most awful experience of his rugged
      life would be enacted.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a shudder he passed on. The trees grew less dense, and then on a rise
      ahead of him he saw his humble cottage, like a cheerless blot on the green
      lush-sward about it. He wanted now to search the face of his wife. For ten
      days, the letter said, she had suffered. She had suffered so much that the
      neighbors had taken up her cause&mdash;they had taken it up when he&mdash;great
      God!&mdash;when he loved her and the children with every tortured cord of
      his being! They had come to his wife's aid against him, her prime enemy.
      Yes, they should whip him, and he would tell them while they were at it to
      lay it on&mdash;to lay it on! and God sanction the cause.
    </p>
    <p>
      He entered the gate. His wife was sitting in the little hall, a wooden
      bowl in her lap, shelling pease; on a blanket at her feet lay the baby. He
      went up the steps and stood in the doorway. She raised her eyes and saw
      him, and then lowered her head, saying nothing, though she was deathly
      pale. He stared helplessly for a moment, and then went out behind the
      house and sat down in a chair under a tree, near his beehives and his
      bent-toothed, stone-weighted harrow. A deeper feeling of despair had come
      over him, for it was the first time his wife had ever refused to greet him
      in some way or other on his return home. On the banks of a spring branch
      below the barn, he saw his older children playing, but he could not bear
      the sight of them, and, with his elbows on his knees, he covered his face
      with his hands. The memory came to him of men who had killed themselves
      when in deep trouble, but he brushed the thought away. They were shirking
      cowards. For half an hour he sat thus. He heard the children laughing as
      they continued their romp up and down the stream. Then his wife slowly
      came out to him. She was still pale, and it seemed to him that she was
      thinner than she had ever been before.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, darlin',&rdquo; she began, with a catch in her voice, &ldquo;some o' the
      neighbors has been tellin' me that I ort not to be kind an' good to you
      when you come home after you've done us this away, an' I acknowledge I did
      try just now to act sorter cold, but I can't. Oh, Pole, I ain't mad at
      you, darlin'! My heart is so full o' joy at seein' you back home, safe an'
      sound, that I don't know what to do. I know you are sorry, darlin', fer
      you always are, an' you look more downcast than I ever seed you in all my
      life. Oh, Pole, I've suffered, I'll admit, but that can't equal my joy
      right now at seein' you home with that sweet, sorry look in yore eyes.
      Pole, darlin', won't you kiss me? You would ef I hadn't turned from you as
      I did in the house jest now. Don't&mdash;don't blame me! I hardly knowed
      what I was doin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      A sob rose in him and burst. She saw his emotion, and put her arms around
      his neck.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It was that meddlesome old Mrs. Snodgrass who put me up to actin' that
      away,&rdquo; she said, tenderly. &ldquo;But I'll never do it ag'in. The idea! An' me
      ever' bit as happy as I was the day we married one another! Thar comes
      little Billy, as hard as he kin move his little fat legs. Wipe yore eyes,
      Pole; don't let him see you a-cryin'. He'd remember it all his life&mdash;childern
      are so quar. Thar, wipe 'em on my apron&mdash;no, le' <i>me</i> do it.
      He's axed about you a hundred times a day. The neighbors' childern talked
      before him an' made him wonder.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The child, red in the face and panting, ran into his father's outstretched
      arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar you been, papa?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Over to Darley, Billy,&rdquo; Pole managed to say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you goin' to stay at home any more, papa?&rdquo; was the next query.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Billy&mdash;I hope so. What have you childern been playing with down
      at the branch?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Johnny made a boat, papa, but it wouldn't swim. It sunk when he put sand
      on it. Will you make me a boat, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Billy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;When, papa?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To-morrow, Billy.&rdquo; Pole pressed his rough face to the child's smooth,
      perspiring brow, and then put him down. &ldquo;Now run and play,&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've put on some coffee to boil,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baker when the child had
      left. &ldquo;I know you want some. Pole, you look all unstrung. I never seed you
      so nervous. Yore hands are twitchin', an' I never seed sech a awful look
      in yore face. Don't you want me to cook some'n' special fer you to eat,
      Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a thing, Sally,&rdquo; he gulped. &ldquo;The coffee is enough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went into the house and came back with it. As she drew near he noted
      that the sun was fast going down; the shadow of the hill, to the west of
      the cottage, was creeping rapidly across the level field below. It would
      soon be eight o'clock, and then&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here it is,&rdquo; said Sally, at his elbow. &ldquo;It's as strong as I could make
      it. It will steady your nerves. Oh, Pole, I'm so glad you got back! I
      couldn't have gone through another night like the others. It would have
      killed me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised the coffee-cup to keep from seeing her wistful, dark-ringed
      eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Night came on apace. He sat in his chair while she busied herself with
      heeding and putting the children to bed. Her voice rang with joy and
      relief as she spoke to them; once she sang a bar of an old ballad. It
      vividly recalled their courtship days. He moved his chair to the porch. He
      sat there awhile, and then went to feed his horse and cattle, telling
      himself, the while, that he had made his wife do his work for the past ten
      days that he might sink to the level of a beast.
    </p>
    <p>
      After supper the two sat together in the moonlight on the porch, he
      silent, she talkative and full of joy. The old-fashioned clock on the
      mantel within struck seven. He waited about half an hour longer, and then
      he rose to his feet.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to go to the store and see Nelson Floyd,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'll be back
      inside of an hour, sure.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She stared at him irresolutely for a moment, then she uttered a low groan.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pole, Pole, Pole! I don't want you to go,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You know why.
      If you get whar any liquor is now, you&mdash;you may go off again. Stay
      with me, Pole! I'll give you some strong coffee. I'll do anything ruther
      than have you out o' my sight now that you are safe at home. You won't
      spile all my happiness by goin' off again. Will you, darlin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He caught her wrist with his left hand and held his right steadily upward.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll swear to you, Sally, before God, that I won't tetch a single drop,
      and that I'll be back inside of an hour. You kin trust me now, Sally. You
      never heard me speak this way before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Their eyes met. &ldquo;Yes, I kin trust you when you talk that away,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;Don't be gone longer than an hour, Pole. I'll set right here on the porch
      and wait for you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right. I'll keep my word, Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out at the gate he passed, moving away, his head down, his long arms
      swinging disconsolately at his sides. When out of sight of the cottage he
      quickened his step. He must not be late. They must not, under any
      circumstances, come nearer to his house than the spring, and he must try
      to secure their promise not to let his degradation reach the ears of his
      wife and children. He could not stand that.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">R</span>EACHING the
      appointed place, he sat down on the trunk of a fallen tree to wait.
      By-and-by he heard voices in the distance, and then the tramp, tramp of
      footsteps. A dark blur appeared in the moonlight on the road. It was a
      body of men numbering between twenty-five and thirty. They were all afoot,
      and, by way of precaution against identification, they wore white caps
      over their heads, with holes for the eyes. In their mouths they had
      stuffed wads of cotton to muffle and disguise their voices.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I see you've acted sensible, Baker,&rdquo; said a man who seemed in the
      lead. &ldquo;Some o' the boys 'lowed you'd cut an' shoot; but you hain't armed,
      are you, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I hain't armed, Joe Dilworthy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, you think you know me!&rdquo; the speaker said, with a start.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I know you,&rdquo; answered Pole. &ldquo;I'd know you anywhar in the world by
      yore shape an' voice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you may <i>think</i> I'm anybody you like,&rdquo; returned the masked
      man. &ldquo;That's neither here nur thar. I've been app'inted to do the talkin'
      to-night, Pole, an' I want to say, at the start, that this is the most
      disagreeable job that this association ever tackled. Yore case has been up
      before our body time after time, an' some'n' always throwed it out, fer
      you've got stacks an' stacks o' friends. But action was finally tuck, an'
      here we are. Pole, do you know any valid reason why you shouldn't be
      treated 'ike other malefactors in these mountains?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Pole's head was hanging down. They could not see his
      face in the moonlight.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I don't see no reason,&rdquo; the condemned man finally said. &ldquo;I'm here to
      meet you, to tell you that I deserve more'n you fellows could lay on me ef
      you begun now an' kept up a steady lick till the last one of you was
      fagged out. The only trouble, gentlemen, is that I hain't a-goin' to <i>feel</i>
      the lash. Thar's a pain inside o' me so keen an' fur down that what you do
      jest to my body won't count. You are the friends of my wife an' childern;
      you are better friends to 'em than I've been, an' I want you to strip me
      to my dirty hide an' whip my duty into me, ef that is possible. The only
      thing I would ask is to spare my folks the knowledge of it, ef you kin see
      it that away. Keep this thing quiet&mdash;jest amongst us. I may be able
      to brace up an' try to do right in the future, but I don't believe I kin
      ef they know o' my humiliation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't ax that as a favor to myself, you understand, gentlemen, but to
      them you are befriendin'&mdash;a weak woman an' helpless little childern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole ceased speaking. There was profound silence, broken only by the
      croaking of frogs in the spring branch near by. Dilworthy thrust his hands
      into the pockets of his trousers awkwardly, and slowly turned his eyeholes
      upon the eyeholes about him, but no one made sign or sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Boys, you all hear what Pole says,&rdquo; finally came from him. &ldquo;He seems to
      feel&mdash;I mought say to realize&mdash;that&mdash;&rdquo; The voice spent
      itself in the folds of the speaker's mask.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hold! I want to say a word.&rdquo; A tall, lank man stepped from the group,
      spitting wads of cotton from his mouth and lifting the cap from his head.
      &ldquo;I'm Jeff Wade, Pole. You see who I am. You kin appear agin me before the
      grand jury an' swear I'm a member o' this gang, ef you want to. I don't
      give a damn. In j'inin' the association, I tuck the oath to abide by what
      the majority done. But I didn't take no oath that I wouldn't talk when I
      got ready, an' I want now to explain, as is my right, I reckon, how I
      happen to be here. I've fit this case agin you fer several meetin's with
      all my soul an' strength, beca'se I knowed you was too good a man at heart
      to whip like a dog fer what you've done. I fit it an' fit it, but last
      meetin' my wife was down havin' another twelve-pound boy, as maybe you
      heard, an' somehow in my absence the vote went agin you. Strong speeches
      was made by yore wife's kin about her treatment, an' action was finally
      tuck. But I'm here to say that every lick that falls on yore helpless back
      to-night will hurt me more than ef they was on me You've made a better man
      out o' me in a few ways, Pole, an', by God! I'm a-goin' to feel like some
      o' that dirty crowd felt away back thar when they went along an'
      sanctioned the death agony of our Saviour. You are too good a man, Pole,
      to be degraded this away. What you've done agin yore own was through
      weakness that you couldn't well help. We've all got our faults, but I
      don't know a man in this gang that's got as many good p'ints to counteract
      the bad as you have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Jeff,&rdquo; Pole said, stolidly. &ldquo;What you say don't excuse
      me. I stand here to-night convicted by my neighbors of mistreatin' my own
      blood an' heart kin, an' I don't want nobody to defend me when sech men as
      Sandy McHugh tuck what was comin' to them without a whimper. I don't know
      what effect it's goin' to have on me. I cayn't see that fur ahead. I've
      tried to quit liquor about as hard as any man alive, an' I'm not goin' to
      make promises an' break 'em. After this is over, I reckon I'll do whatever
      the Lord has laid out fer me to do.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, I'm Mel Jones!&rdquo; Another tall man divested himself of cap and mask
      and stood out in full view. &ldquo;I voted agin this, too. I'm yore friend,
      Pole. That's all I got to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right, Mel,&rdquo; said Pole, &ldquo;an' I'm much obliged to you. But,
      gentlemen, I told my wife I was goin' to town an' would be straight back.
      You hain't said whether it would be possible to keep this thing quiet&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Quiet hell!&rdquo; snorted Dilworthy. &ldquo;Do you damn fools think I'm goin' to act
      as leader fer a lot o' snifflin' idiots that don't know whar they are at
      or how they got thar? It may not be parliamentary by a long shot, but as
      chairman o' this meetin' I'm goin' to say that I think you've all made a
      mess of the whole thing. I 'lowed I could abide by what the majority done
      in any matter that was pendin' before us, but I'll be derned ef I'm in
      favor o' tetchin' <i>that thar man</i>. I'd every bit as soon drag my old
      mammy from the grave an' whip her as a man feelin' like that thar 'un. I
      believe Pole Baker's tried as hard as any livin' mortal to behave hisse'f,
      an' that's enough. A gang o' men that's goin' about whippin' folks who's
      doin' the'r level best ort to be in better business, an' from to-night on&mdash;oath
      or no oath&mdash;I'm a-goin' to let the law o' the land manage the conduct
      o' my neighbors, as fur as I am concerned. It may be contrary to
      parliamentary rules, as I say, but this damn thing is so lopsided to-night
      that I'm a-goin' to put it to another vote. Maybe, ef Pole had a-been
      allowed to 'a' made a statement you'd 'a' seed this thing different. Now,
      all in favor of enactin' the verdict of our court in this case hold up
      yore hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was a portentous pause. Not a hand was raised.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;See thar? What did I tell you?&rdquo; Dilworthy exclaimed, in disgust. &ldquo;Not a
      man amongst you knows his own mind. Now, to the contrary: all in favor o'
      sendin' Baker home without tetchin' him raise yore hands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Every hand went up. Pole stared blankly from one stiff token of pity to
      another, then his head went down. The brim of his old hat hid his face. He
      was silent. The crowd was filtering away. Soon only Jeff Wade was left. He
      gave Pole his hand, and in an awkward voice said: &ldquo;Go home now, old
      friend. Don't let Sally suspicion this. It would hurt her mighty bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole said nothing at all, but, returning Wade's hand-pressure, he moved
      away in the soft moonlight.

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      Sunday morning Nelson Floyd went to church. From the doorway he descried a
      vacant seat on the side of the house occupied by the men and boys, and
      when he had taken it and looked over the well-filled room, he saw that he
      had Cynthia Porter in plain view. She had come alone. A few seats behind
      her he saw Pole Baker and his wife. Pole had never looked better. He wore
      a new suit of clothes and had recently had his hair trimmed. Floyd tried
      to catch his eye, but Pole looked neither to the right nor left, seeming
      only intent on Hillhouse, who had risen to read the chapter from the Bible
      which contained the text for his sermon. In their accustomed places sat
      Captain Duncan and his daughter Evelyn. The old gentleman had placed his
      silk-hat on the floor at the end of the bench on which he sat, and his
      kid-gloved hands rested on his gold-headed, ebony cane, which stood erect
      between his knees.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the service was over and the congregation was passing out, Floyd
      waited for Cynthia, whom he saw coming out immediately behind the Duncans.
      &ldquo;Hello, Floyd; how are you?&rdquo; the captain exclaimed, cordially, as he came
      up. &ldquo;Going home? Daughter and I have a place for you in the carriage and
      will drop you at the hotel&mdash;that is, if you won't let us take you on
      to dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd flushed. Cynthia was now quite near, and he saw from her face that
      she had overheard the invitation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thank you very much, captain,&rdquo; Floyd said, as he smiled and nodded to
      her, &ldquo;but I see that Miss Cynthia is alone, and I was just waiting to ask
      her to let me walk home with her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see!&rdquo; Duncan exclaimed, with a gallant bow and smile to Cynthia. &ldquo;I
      wouldn't break up a nice thing like that if I could. I haven't forgotten
      my young days, and this is the time of the year, my boy, when the grass is
      green and the sun drives you into the shade.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a very haughty nod to Floyd and Cynthia together, Evelyn Duncan
      walked stiffly on ahead of her father.
    </p>
    <p>
      Outside, Cynthia looked straight into the eyes of her escort.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did you refuse Captain Duncan's invitation?&rdquo; she asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why did I?&rdquo; He laughed, mysteriously. &ldquo;Because during service I made up
      my mind that I'd get to you before the parson did; and then I had other
      reasons.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What were they?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gossip,&rdquo; he said, with a low, significant laugh.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gossip? I don't understand,&rdquo; Cynthia said, perplexed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I heard,&rdquo; Floyd replied, &ldquo;that since I've been finally invited to
      Duncan's house I'll run there night and day, and that it will end in my
      marrying that little bunch of lace and ribbons. I heard other
      speculations, too, on my future conduct, and as I saw our village talker,
      Mrs. Snodgrass, was listening just now, I was tickled at the chance to
      decline the invitation and walk home with you. It will be all over the
      country by night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They were traversing a cool, shaded road now, and as most of the
      congregation had taken other directions, they were comparatively alone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Evelyn Duncan is in love with you,&rdquo; Cynthia said, abruptly, her glance on
      the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ridiculous,&rdquo; Floyd laughed. &ldquo;Simply ridiculous.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I saw it in her face when you said you were going home with
      me. She could have bitten my head off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, I've never talked with her more than two or three times in
      all my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That may be, but she has heard dozens of people say it will be just the
      thing for you to marry her, and she has wondered&mdash;&rdquo; Cynthia stopped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, little woman, we've had enough of this,&rdquo; Floyd said, abruptly.
      &ldquo;I saw the light in your room the other night, and I stood and whistled
      and whistled, but you wouldn't come to me. I had a lot to tell you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told you I'd never meet you that way again, and I meant it.&rdquo; Cynthia
      was looking straight into his eyes. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you did, but I thought you might relent. I was chock full of my
      new discovery&mdash;or rather Pole Baker's&mdash;and I wanted to pour it
      out on you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course, you are happy over it?&rdquo; Cynthia said, tentatively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It has been the one great experience of my life,&rdquo; said Floyd,
      impressively. &ldquo;No one who has not been through it, Cynthia, can have any
      idea of what it means. It is on my mind at night when I go to bed; it is
      in my dreams; it is in my thoughts when I get up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wanted to know about your mother,&rdquo; ventured the girl, reverently. &ldquo;What
      was she like?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That is right where I'm in the dark,&rdquo; Floyd answered. &ldquo;Pole didn't get my
      new relative to say a thing about her. I would have written to him at
      length, but Pole advised me to wait till I could see him personally. My
      uncle seems to be a crusty, despondent, unlucky sort of old fellow, and,
      as there was a kind of estrangement between him and my father, Pole thinks
      it would irritate him to have to answer my letters. However, I am going
      down to Atlanta to call on him next Wednesday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;Speaking of Pole Baker&mdash;I suppose you
      heard of what the White Caps did the other night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it pained me deeply,&rdquo; said Floyd, &ldquo;for I was the indirect cause
      of the whole trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, Pole is this way: It is usually some big trouble or great joy that
      throws him off his balance, and it was the good news he brought to me that
      upset him. It was in my own room at the hotel, too, that he found the
      whiskey. A bottle of it was on my table and he slipped it into his pocket
      and took it off with him. I never missed it till I heard he was on a
      spree. His friends are trying to keep his wife from finding out about the
      White Caps.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They needn't trouble further,&rdquo; Cynthia said, bitterly. &ldquo;I was over there
      yesterday. Mrs. Snodgrass had just told her about it, and I thought the
      poor woman would die. She ordered Mrs. Snodgrass out of the house, telling
      her never to darken her door again, and she stood on the porch, as white
      as death, screaming after her at the top of her voice. Mrs. Snodgrass was
      so frightened that she actually broke into a run.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The old hag!&rdquo; Floyd said, darkly. &ldquo;I wish the same gang would take her
      out some night and tie her tongue at least.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Baker came back to me then,&rdquo; Cynthia went on. &ldquo;She put her head in
      my lap and sobbed as if her heart would break. Nothing I could possibly
      say would comfort her. She worships the ground Pole walks on. And she <i>ought</i>
      to love him. He's good and noble and full of tenderness. She saw him
      coming while we were talking, and quickly dried her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'He mustn't see me crying,' she said. 'If he thought I knew this he would
      never get over it.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came in then and noticed her red eyes, and I saw him turn pale as he
      sat studying her face. Then to throw him off she told him a fib. She told
      him I'd been taking her into my confidence about something which she was
      not at liberty to reveal.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; exclaimed Floyd, admiringly. &ldquo;She's a shrewd little woman&mdash;nearly
      as shrewd as he is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he acted queerly after that, I must say,&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia went on. &ldquo;He at once quit looking at her, and sat staring at me in
      the oddest way. I spoke to him, but he wouldn't answer. When I was going
      home, he followed me as far as the bam. 'You couldn't tell me that secret,
      could you, little sister?' he said, with a strange, excited look on his
      face. Of course, I saw that he thought it was some trouble of mine, but I
      couldn't set him right and be true to his wife, and so I said nothing. He
      walked on with me to the branch, still looking worried; then, when we were
      about to part, he held out his hand. 'I want to say right here, little
      sister,' he said, 'that I love you like a brother, and if any harm comes
      to you, <i>in any way</i>, I'll be with you.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's very queer,&rdquo; said Floyd, thoughtfully. They were now near the house
      and he paused. &ldquo;I'll not go any farther,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;It will do no good to
      disturb your mother. She hates the ground I walk on. She will only make it
      unpleasant for you if she sees us together. Good-bye, I'll see you when I
      get back from Atlanta.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      Wednesday afternoon, when he had concluded his business at one of the
      larger wholesale houses in Atlanta, Nelson Floyd took a street-car for his
      uncle's residence. Reaching it, he was met at the door by the white woman
      who had admitted Pole Baker to the house on his visit to Atlanta. She
      explained that her master had only gone across the street to see a
      neighbor, and that he would be back at once. She led Floyd into the
      old-fashioned parlor and gave him one of the dilapidated, hair-cloth
      chairs, remaining in the room to put a few things to rights, and dusting
      the furniture with her apron. On either side of the mantel-piece hung a
      crude oil-portrait, in cracked and chipped gilt frames of very massive
      make. The one on the right was that of a dark-haired gentleman in the
      conventional dress of seventy-five years previous. The other was evidently
      his wife, a woman of no little beauty. They were doubtless family
      portraits, and Floyd regarded them with reverential interest. The servant
      saw him looking at them and remarked: &ldquo;They are Mr. Floyd's mother and
      father, sir. The pictures were made a long time ago. Old Mr. Floyd was a
      very smart man in his day, and his wife was considered a great beauty and
      a belle, so I've heard folks say, though I'm sure I don't see how any
      woman could be popular with her hair fixed that bungly way. But Mr. Floyd
      is very proud of the pictures. He wouldn't sell them for any price. We
      thought the house was going to burn down one day when the kitchen-stove
      turned over, and he sprained his ankle climbing up in a chair to get them
      down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They are my grandparents,&rdquo; he told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say! Then you are Mr. Floyd's&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm his nephew. My name is Floyd&mdash;Nelson Floyd. I've never met my
      uncle.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see!&rdquo; The woman's brow was corrugated. &ldquo;Mr. Floyd <i>did</i> have a
      brother who died young, but I don't think I ever heard him speak of him.
      But he don't talk much to anybody, and now&mdash;la me!&mdash;he's so
      worried over his business that he's as near crazy as any man I ever saw.
      You say you haven't ever seen him! Then you'd better not expect him to be
      very sociable. As I say, he's all upset over business. The way he's doing
      is the talk of the neighborhood. There, I heard the gate shut. I reckon
      that's him now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went to one of the front windows and parted the curtains and looked
      out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's him. I'll go and tell him you are here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson heard the door open and close and then muffled voices, a gruff,
      masculine one, and that of the servant lowered persuasively. Heavy steps
      passed on down the hall, and then the woman came back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I told him you was here, sir,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;He's gone to his room, but will
      be back in a minute. He's queer, sir; if you haven't seen him before you
      had as well be prepared for that. I heard Dr. Plympton say the other day
      that if he didn't stop worrying as he is that he'd have a stroke of
      paralysis.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The woman retired and the visitor sat for several moments alone. Presently
      he heard the heavy-steps in the hall and Henry A. Floyd came in. He was
      very pale, his skin appearing almost ashen in color, and his eyes, under
      their heavy brows, had a restless, shifting expression. Nelson felt
      repelled in a way he could not account for. The old man failed to offer
      any greeting, and it was only the caller's extended hand that seemed to
      remind him of the courtesy due a stranger. Even then only the ends of his
      cold fingers touched those of the young man. A thrill of intense and
      disagreeable surprise passed over Nelson, for his uncle stood staring at
      him steadily, without uttering a word.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did your servant tell you who I am?&rdquo; the young man ventured, in no little
      embarrassment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, she told me,&rdquo; old Floyd answered. &ldquo;She told me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;From your stand-point, sir,&rdquo; Nelson said, &ldquo;perhaps I have little excuse
      for coming to see you without an intimation from you that such a visit
      would be welcome, but I confess I was so anxious to hear, something from
      you about my parents that I couldn't wait longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, I see, I see!&rdquo; exclaimed the old man, his glance on the floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may understand my eagerness more fully,&rdquo; said Nelson, &ldquo;when I tell
      you that you are the first and only blood relative I remember ever to have
      seen.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The old man shrugged his bent shoulders, and Nelson was almost sure that
      he sneered, but no sound came from his tightly compressed lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      The young man, in even greater embarrassment, looked at the portraits on
      the wall, and, for the lack of anything more appropriate to say, remarked:
      &ldquo;Your servant tells me that these are my grandparents&mdash;your father
      and mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, they are my parents,&rdquo; the old man said, deep down in his throat.
      Then all of a sudden his eyes began to flash angrily. &ldquo;That old hussy's
      been talking behind my back, has she? I'll teach her what her place is in
      my house, if&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, she only answered a question or two of mine,&rdquo; said Nelson,
      pacifically. &ldquo;I told her you were my uncle and for that reason I was
      interested in family portraits.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Your uncle!</i>&rdquo; That was all the reply old Floyd made.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelson stared at him in deep perplexity for a moment, then he said: &ldquo;I
      hope I am not on the wrong track, sir. A friend of mine&mdash;a rough
      mountaineer, it's true, but a sterling fellow&mdash;called here some time
      ago, and he came back and told me that you said&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He came here like the spy that he was,&rdquo; snorted the old man. &ldquo;He came
      here to my house pretending to want to rent land, and in that way got into
      my confidence and had me talk about family matters; but he didn't want to
      rent land. When he failed to come back my suspicions were roused and I
      made inquiries. I found out that he was the sharpest, keenest man among
      mountain revenue detectives, and that he had no idea of leaving his
      present location. Now I'd simply like to know what you and he are after. I
      haven't got anything for you&mdash;not a dollar in the world, nor any
      property that isn't mortgaged up to the hilt. Why did you send a man of
      that kind to me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You actually astound me, sir,&rdquo; Nelson said. &ldquo;I hardly know what to say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you don't&mdash;now that I hurl the unexpected truth into your
      teeth. You didn't think I'd be sharp enough to inquire about that fellow
      Baker, did you? You thought a man living here in a city as big as this
      would let a green country lout like that get him in a trap. Huh! But I
      wasn't a fool, sir. You thought you were getting facts from me through
      him, but you were not, by a long shot. I wasn't going to tell a stranger
      like that delicate family matters. God knows your father's conduct was
      disgraceful enough without my unfolding his life to a coarse greenhorn so
      long after his death. You know the reputation my brother Charles had,
      don't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not till it came from you, sir,&rdquo; said Nelson, coldly. &ldquo;Baker told me you
      said he was a little wild, that he drank&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father kicked him out of our home, I tell you,&rdquo; the old man snapped.
      &ldquo;He told him never to darken his door again, after the way he lived before
      the war and during it. It completely broke that woman's heart.&rdquo; Old Floyd
      pointed a' trembling finger at his mother's portrait. &ldquo;I don't understand
      why you&mdash;how you can come here as you do, calling me your uncle as if
      you had a right to do so.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Right to do so?&mdash;stop!&rdquo; Nelson took him up sharply. &ldquo;What do you
      mean? I've the right to ask that, sir, anyway.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you know what I mean, I reckon. That man Baker intimated that you
      knew all about your family history. You know that your mother and my poor,
      deluded brother were never married, that they&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not married!&rdquo; Nelson Floyd shrank as if he had been struck in the face.
      &ldquo;For God's sake don't say that! I can stand anything but that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't ask you to believe me without ample proof,&rdquo; old Floyd answered,
      harshly. &ldquo;Wait here a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson sank into a chair, and pale and trembling, and with a heart that
      seemed dead within him, he watched the old man move slowly from the room.
      Old Floyd returned presently. An expression that seemed born of grim,
      palpitating satisfaction lay on his colorless face; a triumphant light
      blazed in his sullen eyes. He held some books and a package of letters in
      his hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Here are your father's letters to my parents,&rdquo; he began. &ldquo;The letters
      will tell the whole story. They bear his signature. If you doubt their
      authenticity&mdash;if you think the name is forged, you can compare it to
      all the specimens of his writing in these old school-books of his. This is
      a diary he kept in college. You can see from its character how his life
      was tending. The letters are later, after he met your mother&mdash;a
      French girl&mdash;in New Orleans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment Nelson stared up into the withered face above him, and then,
      with a groan of dawning conviction, he took the letters. He opened the one
      on the top.
    </p>
    <p>
      How strange! The handwriting was not unlike his own. But that was too
      trivial to marvel over. It was the contents of the letter that at once
      benumbed and tore his heart in twain.
    </p>
    <p>
      <i>&ldquo;Dear father and mother,&rdquo; it began; &ldquo;I am longing for the old home
      to-night; but, as you say, it is perhaps best that I should never come
      back again, especially as the facts are known in the neighborhood. The
      things you write me in regard to Annette's past are, alas! only too true.
      I don't deny them. Perhaps I'm the only one in the world who will overlook
      them, for I happen to know how she was tried by poverty and temptation
      when she was hardly more than a child. But on one point I can set your
      minds at rest. You seem to think that I intend to marry her; but I promise
      you now that I shall never link your honored name to hers. Really the poor
      girl doesn't wish it. She seems to understand how you feel exactly. And
      the baby! you are worried over its future. Let that go. As soon as the war
      is over, I shall do my full duty by it. It is nameless, as you say, and
      that fact may sting it later in life, but such things have happened
      before, and, my dear father and mother, young men have fallen into bad
      ways before, and&mdash;&rdquo;</i>
    </p>
    <p>
      Nelson Floyd read no further. Turning the time-stained sheet over, he saw
      his father's signature. With lifeless fingers he opened one or two of the
      other letters. He tried to glance at the fly-leaves of the books on his
      quivering knees, but there was a blur before his sight. The scrawny hands
      of the old man were stretched out to prevent the mass from falling to the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you satisfied? That's the main thing,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Because, if you are
      not, there are plenty of legal records which&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied.&rdquo; Nelson stood up, his inert hand on the back of the
      rocking-chair he had just vacated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to say if you are not I can give you further proof. I can
      cite to you old legal documents to which my brother signed his name. He
      got hard up and sold a piece of land to me once. I have that deed. You are
      welcome to&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am satisfied.&rdquo; Those words seemed the only ones of which the young
      man's bewildered brain were capable. But he was a gentleman to the core of
      his being. &ldquo;I'm sorry I intruded on you, Mr. Floyd. Only blind ignorance
      on my part&mdash;&rdquo; He went no further.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inanimate objects about him, the chairs, the table, the door towards
      which he was moving, seemed to have life.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, good-day.&rdquo; Old Floyd remained in the centre of the room, the books
      and letters held awkwardly under his stiff arm. &ldquo;I see that you were not
      expecting this revelation, but you might as-well have been told to-day as
      later. I understand that the Duncans and Prices up your way are under
      wrong impressions about your social standing, but I didn't want to be the
      one to open their eyes. I really don't care myself. However, a thing like
      that is sure to get out sooner or later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They shall know the truth,&rdquo; said Floyd, with the lips of a dead man. &ldquo;I
      shall not sail under false colors. Good-day, Mr. Floyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Out into the broad, balmy sunlight the young man went. There was a
      despondent droop upon him. His step was slow and uncertain, his feet
      seemed to him to have weights attached to them. He walked on to the corner
      of the next street and leaned against a tree. From the city's palpitating
      heart and stony veins came the hum of traffic on wheels, the clanging of
      bells, the escaping of steam. Near by some one was practising a monotonous
      exercise on a piano. He looked up at the sky with the stare of a subject
      under hypnotic influence.
    </p>
    <p>
      A lump was in his dry throat. He made an effort to swallow it down, but it
      stuck and pained him. Persons passing caught sight of his face and threw
      back stares of mute inquiry as they moved on. After half an hour of
      aimless wandering here and there through the crowded streets, he paused at
      the door of a bar-room. He recognized the big gilt sign on the plate-glass
      windows, and remembered being there years before at midnight with some
      jolly friends and being taken to his hotel in a cab. After all, whiskey
      now, as then, would furnish forgetfulness, and that was his right. He went
      in and sat down at a little round table in the corner of the room. On a
      shelf near him was a bowl of brown pretzels, a plate of salted pop-corn, a
      saucer of parched coffee-beans mixed with cloves. One of the bartenders
      came to him, a towel over his arm. &ldquo;What will you have, sir?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Rye whiskey straight,&rdquo; said the customer, his eyes on the sawdust at his
      feet. &ldquo;Bring the bottle along.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>O Cynthia the day
      on which she expected Floyd to return from Atlanta passed slowly.
      Something told her that he would come straight to her from the station, on
      his arrival, and she was impatient to hear his news. The hack usually
      brought passengers over at six o'clock, and at that time she was on the
      porch looking expectantly down the road leading to the village. But he did
      not come. Seven o'clock struck&mdash;eight; supper was over and her
      parents and her grandmother were in bed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I simply will not go to meet him in the grape-arbor any more,&rdquo; she said
      to herself. &ldquo;He is waiting to come later, but I'll not go out, as much as
      I'd like to hear about his mother. He thinks my curiosity will drive me to
      it, but he shall see.&rdquo; However, when alone in her room she paced the floor
      in an agony of indecision and beset by strange, unaccountable forebodings.
      Might not something have happened to him? At nine o'clock she was in bed,
      but not asleep. At half-past nine she got up. The big bed of feathers
      seemed a great, smothering instrument of torture; she could scarcely get
      her breath. Throwing a shawl over her, she went out on the porch and sat
      down in a chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      She had been there only a moment when she heard her mother's step in the
      hall, and, turning her head, she saw the gaunt old woman's form in the
      doorway.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I heard you walking about,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, coldly, &ldquo;and got up to see
      what was the matter. Are you sick?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, mother, I simply am not sleepy, that's all.&rdquo; The old woman advanced a
      step nearer, her sharp eyes on the girl's white night-gown and bare feet.
      &ldquo;Good gracious!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;You'll catch your death of cold. Go in the
      house this minute. I'll bet I know why you can't sleep. You are worried
      about what people are saying about Nelson Floyd's marrying Evelyn Duncan
      and throwing you over, as he no doubt has many other girls.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wasn't thinking of it, mother.&rdquo; Cynthia rose and started in. &ldquo;He can
      marry her if he wants to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, well, you can pretend all you like. I reckon your pride would make
      you defend yourself. Now, go in the house.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In the darkness of her room Cynthia sat on the side of her bed. She heard
      her mother's bare feet as the old woman went along the hall back to her
      room in the rear. Floyd might be in the grape-arbor now. As her light was
      extinguished, he would think she had gone to bed, and he would not
      whistle. Then a great, chilling doubt struck her. Perhaps he had really
      gone to Duncan's to see Evelyn. But no, a warm glow stole over her as she
      remembered that he had declined to go home from church in the captain's
      carriage that he might walk with her. No, it was not that; but perhaps
      some accident had happened to him&mdash;the stage-horses might have become
      frightened on that dangerous mountain road. The driver was often
      intoxicated, and in that condition was known to be reckless. Cynthia threw
      herself back in bed and pulled the light covering over her, but she did
      not go to sleep till far towards morning.
    </p>
    <p>
      The sun was up when she awoke. Her mother was standing near her, a
      half-repentant look flitting over her wrinkled face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't get up unless you feel like it,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I've done your work and
      am keeping your coffee and breakfast warm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, mother.&rdquo; Cynthia sat up, her mind battling with both dreams
      and realities.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't look like you are well,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said. &ldquo;I watched you
      before you waked up. You are awfully dark under the eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll feel all right when I am up and stirring around,&rdquo; Cynthia said,
      avoiding her mother's close scrutiny. &ldquo;I tell you I'm not sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When she had dressed herself and gone out into the dining-room she found a
      delicious breakfast waiting for her, but she scarcely touched the food.
      The coffee she drank for its stimulating effect, and felt better. All that
      morning, however, she was the helpless victim of recurring forebodings.
      When her father came in from the village at noon she hung about him,
      hoping that he would drop some observation from which she might learn if
      Floyd had returned, but the quaint old gossip seemed to talk of everything
      except the subject to which her soul seemed bound.
    </p>
    <p>
      About the middle of the afternoon Mrs. Porter said she wanted a spool of
      cotton thread, and Cynthia offered to go to the village for it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not in this hot sun,&rdquo; the old woman objected.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I could keep in the shade all the way,&rdquo; Cynthia told her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, if you'll do that, you may go,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter gave in. &ldquo;I don't know
      but what the exercise will do you good. I tell you, I don't like the looks
      of your skin and eyes. I'm afraid you are going to take down sick. You
      didn't touch breakfast and ate very little dinner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia managed to laugh reassuringly as she went for her hat and
      sunshade. Indeed, the prospect even of activity had driven touches of
      color into her cheeks and her step was light and alert as she started off&mdash;so
      at least thought Mrs. Porter, who was looking after her from a window. But
      what did the trip amount to? At Mayhew &amp; Floyd's store Joe Peters
      waited on her and had nothing to say of Floyd. While the clerk's back was
      turned Cynthia threw a guarded glance in the direction of Floyd's desk,
      but the shadows of the afternoon had enveloped that part of the room in
      obscurity, and she saw nothing that would even indirectly reply to her
      heart's question. It was on her tongue to inquire if Floyd had returned,
      but her pride laid a firm hand over her pretty mouth, and with her small
      purchase tightly clasped in her tense fingers, she went out into the
      street and turned her face homeward.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next day passed in much the same way, and the night. Then two other
      days and nights of racking torture came and went. The very lack of
      interest in the subject, of those about her, was maddening. She was sure
      now that something vital had happened to her lover, and Saturday at noon,
      when her father came from the village, she saw that he was the bearer of
      news. She knew, too, that it concerned Floyd before the old man had opened
      his lips.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, what you reckon has happened?&rdquo; Nathan asked, with one of his
      unctuous smiles. &ldquo;You two women could guess, an' guess, fer two thousand
      years, an' then never git in a mile o' what everybody in town is talkin'
      about.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's heart sank like a plummet. It was coming&mdash;the grim,
      horrible revelation she had feared. But her father was subtly enjoying the
      blank stare in her eyes, the depth of which was beyond his comprehension.
      As usual, he purposely hung fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Nathan?&rdquo; his wife said, entreatingly. &ldquo;Don't keep us waiting
      as you always do.&rdquo; She looked at Cynthia and remarked: &ldquo;It's something out
      of the common. I can see that from the way he begins.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porter laughed dryly. &ldquo;You kin bet yore sweet lives it's out o' the
      common, but I hain't no hand to talk when my throat's parched dry with
      thirst. I cayn't drink that town water, nohow. Has any fresh been
      fetched?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Just this minute,&rdquo; declared his wife, and she hastened to the water-shelf
      in the entry, returning with a dripping gourd. &ldquo;Here, drink it! You won't
      say a word till you are ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Porter drank slowly. &ldquo;You may <i>call</i> that fresh water,&rdquo; he sneered,
      &ldquo;but you wouldn't ef you had it to swallow. I reckon you'd call old stump
      water fresh ef you could git news any the quicker by it. Well, it's about
      Nelson Floyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nelson Floyd!&rdquo; gasped Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;He's gone and married Evelyn Duncan&mdash;that's
      my guess.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain't that,&rdquo; declared Porter. &ldquo;An' it ain't another Wade gal
      scrape that anybody knows of. The fact is nobody don't know <i>what</i> it
      is. Floyd went down to Atlanta Wednesday, so Mayhew says, to lay in a few
      articles o' stock that was out, an' to call on that new uncle o' his. He
      was to be back Wednesday night, without fail, to draw up some important
      mortgages fer the firm, an' a dozen customers has been helt over in town
      fer two days. They all had to go back without transactin' business, fer
      Floyd didn't turn up. Nor he didn't write a line, nuther. And, although
      old Mayhew has been firin' telegrams down thar, fust to Nelson an' later
      to business houses, not a thing has been heard o' the young man since last
      Wednesday. He hain't registered at no hotel in Atlanta. One man has been
      found that said he knowed Floyd by sight, an' that he had seed 'im walkin'
      about at night in the vilest street in Atlanta lookin' like a dead man or
      one plumb bereft of his senses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stood staring at her father with expanded eyes, and then she sat
      down near a window, her face averted from the others. She said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's crazy,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;I've always thought something was wrong
      with that man. His whole life shows it. He was an outlaw when he was a
      child, and when he grew up he put on high' an' mighty airs, an' started to
      drinkin' like a lord. He'd no sooner let up on that than he got into that
      Wade trouble, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some think he was drugged, an' maybe put out of the way on the sly,&rdquo; said
      Porter, bluntly. &ldquo;But I don't know. Thoughts is cheap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Nathan!&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, under her breath, for Cynthia had risen,
      and without looking to the right or left was moving from the room. &ldquo;This
      may kill that poor child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Kill her, a dog's hind foot!&rdquo; Porter sneered. &ldquo;To be a woman yorse'f, you
      are the porest judge of 'em I ever seed. You women are so dead anxious to
      have some man die fer you that you think the same reckless streak runs in
      yore own veins. You all said Minnie Wade had tuck powdered glass when she
      was sick that time an' was goin' to pass in 'er checks on this feller's
      account, but she didn't die fer him, nor fer Thad Pelham, nor the two
      Thomas boys, nor Abe Spring, nor none o' the rest.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ought to be ashamed of speaking of your own child in the same breath
      with that girl,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, insincerely, her eyes anxiously on the
      door through which Cynthia had gone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't bunchin' 'em together at all,&rdquo; Porter declared. &ldquo;I was only
      tryin' to keep you from layin' in a burial outfit that may go out o'
      fashion 'fore Cynthy wants to use it. You watch 'er an' you'll see 'er
      pick up' in a day or so. I've seed widows wear black so heavy that the dye
      in the goods seemed to soak into the'r skins an' drip of'n the'r
      eyelashes, an' them same women was wearin' red stockin's an' flirtin' em
      at another fool inside of a month.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't know what you are talking about,&rdquo; responded Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;It is
      going hard with her, but I really hope Floyd'll not come back to
      Spring-town. I don't feel safe with him around.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want 'im here,&rdquo; sneered Porter, &ldquo;but yo're dead sure his
      absence is a-goin' to lay our only child under the sod. That's about as
      sensible as the stand a woman takes on most questions. As fer me, I
      confess I'm sorter upset. I'd about made up my mind that our little gal
      was goin' to yank that chap an' his boodle into this family before long,
      but it looks like I was off in my calculations. To look at her now, a body
      wouldn't think she was holdin' the drivin'-reins very tight. But come what
      may, storm, hail, wind, rain, or sunshine an' fine crops, I'll be the only
      one, I reckon, in this house that will sleep sound to-night. An' that's
      whar you are all a set o' fools. A person that loses sleep wonderin'
      whether another person is dead or alive mought be in better business, in
      this day and time, when just <i>anybody</i> is liable to drap dead in
      the'r tracks. La, me! What you got fer dinner? I smell some'n' a-cookin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      And Porter went into the kitchen, got down on his knees at the stove, and
      looked into it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's all right,&rdquo; he said to himself, with a chuckle, &ldquo;but she hain't
      put half enough gravy on it, an' ef I hadn't a-been here to 'a' turned it,
      it 'ud not 'a' got cooked clean through. If it's tough I'll raise a row. I
      told 'em to sell the tough 'uns. What's the use o' raisin' hens ef you
      have to eat the scrubs an' don't git half-pay fer the ones you send to
      market?&rdquo;

      XXVII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span> WEEK went by. To
      Cynthia its days were veritable months of mental torture. Porter came in
      one day at sundown from the village. As usual, he had something to say
      regarding the all-absorbing topic of Nelson Floyd's mysterious
      disappearance. Through the day neighbors had been in with many vague and
      groundless rumors, all of which were later discredited, but Nathan Porter,
      sardonic old observer that hie was, usually got nearer the facts than any
      one else, and in consequence he was always listened to.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's anybody heard now?&rdquo; his wife asked him, as he came through the
      gate to where she and Cynthia sat on the porch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They've heard a lots,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Among other things, it's finally leaked
      out that Lee's surrendered an' the niggers is all declared free. Some say
      George Washington has jest crossed the Delaware in a tippy-canoe, an' that
      Napoleon discovered America, but I doubt it. What I want to know is
      whether supper is ready or not.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it isn't,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter made haste to inform him, &ldquo;but it will be in a
      few minutes. The table's set an' all is ready, except the bread isn't
      quite done. Now, what have you heard in town?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A body kin hear a lots,&rdquo; Porter drawled out. &ldquo;The trouble is to keep from
      listenin' to so much. People are standin' as thick about Mayhew &amp;
      Floyd's shebang as flies over a fresh ginger-cake. You two are the only
      women in the county that hain't been thar, an' I'm proud of the
      distinction. Old Mrs. Snodgrass mighty nigh had a fisticuff fight to
      retain her corner in the store, whar she's had 'er distributin' office fer
      the last week. Joe Peters needed the space. He tried to put a coop o'
      chickens thar, but you bet the chickens had to go some'rs else. Mrs. Snod'
      said she was gittin' hard o' hearin', an' ef she wasn't right thar in the
      front she wouldn't git a thing till it was second-handed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I get out of all patience with you,&rdquo; cried Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;Why does it
      take you so long to get to a point?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The truth is, thar ain't any rale developments as I kin see,&rdquo; Porter gave
      in, reluctantly. &ldquo;Old Mayhew, though, is back from Atlanta. He sets thar,
      as yaller as a pumpkin, without much to say. He's got a rope tied to every
      nickel he owns, an' he sees absolute ruin ahead o' the firm. He's depended
      on Nelson Floyd's popularity an' brains to keep things a-goin' so long
      that now he's like a loaded wagon runnin' downhill without a tongue,
      swingle-tree, or hold-back strop. You see, ef Nelson Floyd is dead, or put
      out o' the way&mdash;accordin' to Mrs. Snodgrass, who heard a Darley
      lawyer say it&mdash;why the young man's interest in the business will
      slide over to his new kin&mdash;a receiver will have to be appointed an'
      Mayhew closed up. Mrs. Snod' is authority fer the statement that Floyd's
      uncle has connived agin the boy to git his pile, an' bliffed 'im in the
      head with a sock full o' sand or some'n' equally as deadly. I dunno. I
      never knowed her to be right about anything, an' I hain't a-goin' to
      believe Floyd's dead till the report comes from some other direction. But
      this much seems to have foundation in fact: Mayhew <i>did</i> go down; he
      <i>did</i> make inquiries of the police; an' some <i>say</i>&mdash;now,
      mind you, I hain't a-standin' fer this&mdash;some say he paid out solid
      coin to git expert detectives a-holt o' the matter. They say the
      detectives run across a low-class hotel out in the edge o' town whar a
      feller answerin' Floyd's description had come in the night after the boy
      left here an' axed fer a room. They say he was lookin' awful&mdash;like he
      had been on a big jag, an' when they give 'im the pen to register he
      studied a minute an' then thro wed it at the clerk, an' told 'im he didn't
      have no name to sign, an' turned an' stalked out. That was the last seed
      of 'im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' that's all you heard,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, in disgust.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All but one thing more,&rdquo; Porter replied. &ldquo;Folks about here that has
      missed Pole Baker fer the last three days 'lowed he was off on another
      bender, but he was down thar in Atlanta nosin' around tryin' to find
      Floyd. Old Mayhew paid his expenses. He said Pole had a longer head on 'im
      than any detective in the bunch. Pole got back about two hours ago, but
      what he discovered not even Mrs. Snod' knows. Him an' Mayhew had the'r
      heads clamped together in the rear end o' the store fer an hour, but Joe
      Peters helt the crowd back, an' thar it stands.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pig-oop-pig-oo! Pig-oop-pig-oo!&rdquo; The mellow, resonant sound floated to
      them on the still air. Porter smiled.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's Pole now callin' his hogs,&rdquo; he said, laconically. &ldquo;The blamed fool
      told me t'other day he was goin' to fatten them pigs on buttermilk, but
      that sort o' fat won't stick any more'n whiskey bloat on a reformed
      drunkard. By the time he drives 'em to market they'll look as flabby as a
      ripe tomato with the inside squashed out. Speakin' o' hogs, I want you-uns
      to fry me a piece o' that shuck-sausage on the top shelf in the
      smoke-house. You'd better go git it now. Swallowin' all that gush in town
      has made me want some'n' solid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When her mother and father had gone into the house Cynthia hastened across
      the fields through the gathering dusk in the direction of Pole Baker's
      voice. He would tell her, she was sure, if anything of importance had
      turned up concerning Floyd, and she could not bear the thought of another
      night of suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently, through the dusk, she saw Pole at his hog-pen in the edge of a
      little thicket behind his cottage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pig-oop-pig-oo!&rdquo; she heard him calling. &ldquo;Dem yore lazy hides, ef you
      don't come on I'll empty this bucket o' slop on the ground an' you kin
      root fer it. I've mighty nigh ripped the linin' out o' my throat on yore
      account.&rdquo; Then he descried Cynthia coming towards him over the dew-damp
      grass and he paused, leaning on the rail-fence, his eyes resting
      expectantly on her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it's you, little sister!&rdquo; he exclaimed, pleasantly. &ldquo;That's sorter
      foolish o' you gittin' them little feet o' yore'n wet in this dew. It may
      settle on yore lungs an' keep you from j'inin' in the singin' Sunday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see you,&rdquo; Cynthia said, in a voice that shook. &ldquo;I heard you
      calling your hogs, and thought I'd catch you here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, little sister, I hain't very nice-lookin' in this old shirt an'
      pants of many colors, like Joseph's coat, but every patch was sewed on by
      the fingers o' the sweetest, most patient little woman God ever made, an'
      I hain't ashamed of 'em; but she is&mdash;God bless 'er!&mdash;an' she'd
      have a spasm ef she knowed I talked to you in 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My father says you went down to Atlanta,&rdquo; Cynthia said, falteringly, &ldquo;and
      I thought&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went down.&rdquo; Pole avoided her fixed stare.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You went to see if you could learn anything of Mr. Floyd's whereabouts,
      didn't you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I did, little sister. I hain't a-talkin' much. Mayhew says it's best
      to sorter lie low until some'n' accurate is found out, an' while I did my
      level best down thar, I've got to acknowledge I'm as much in the dark as
      anybody else. In fact, I'm mighty nigh bothered to death over it. Nelson,
      poor boy, seems to have disappeared clean off'n the face o' the earth. The
      only thing I have to build on is the fact that&mdash;an' I hate to say it,
      little sister&mdash;the fact that he evidently <i>did</i> start to
      drinkin' again. He told me once that he wasn't plumb sure o' hisse'f, an'
      that any big trouble or despair might overthrow his resolutions. Now, he's
      been drinkin', I reckon&mdash;an' what could 'a' been his trouble? I went
      three times to his uncle's, but the doctors wouldn't let me see 'im. The
      old man's broke down with nervous prostration from business troubles, an'
      they are afeard he's goin' to kick the bucket. Comin' back on the cars&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole's voice died away. He crossed and recrossed his hands on the fence.
      He avoided her steady stare. His massive eyebrows met on his wrinkled
      forehead. It was as if he were suffering inward pain. &ldquo;I say&mdash;as I
      set in the train on the way back tryin' an' tryin' to find some
      explanation, the idea come to me that&mdash;since trouble was evidently
      what upset Nelson&mdash;that maybe you mought be able to throw some light
      on it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Me</i>, Mr. Baker?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole hung his head; he spat slowly. Was she mistaken, or had he actually
      turned pale? Was it that, or a trick of her vision in the vague starlight?
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Little sister,&rdquo; he said, huskily, &ldquo;you could trust me with yore life. I'd
      die rather than&mdash;than not stand to you in anything on earth. You see,
      if you happened to know any reason why Nelson Floyd&mdash;&rdquo; Pole was
      interrupted by the loud grunting and squealing of his drove of hogs as
      they rushed round the fence-corner towards him. &ldquo;Wait,&rdquo; he said&mdash;&ldquo;wait
      till I pour the'r feed in the trough.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He took up the pail and disappeared for a moment behind the cow-house.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia felt a great lump of wondering suspense in her throat. What could
      he mean? What was coming? She had never seen Pole act so strangely before.
      Presently he came back to her, holding the dripping paddle with which he
      had stirred the dregs in the bottom of his slop-bucket. He leaned over the
      fence again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, it's this away, little sister,&rdquo; he began, lamely. &ldquo;You an'
      Nelson&mdash;that is, you an' him was sorter runnin' together. He went
      with you, I reckon, more, on the whole, than with any other young lady in
      this section, an', you see, ef anybody was in a position to know any
      particular trouble or worry he had, you mought be that one.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I'm afraid I don't know anything of the kind,&rdquo; she said, wonderingly,
      her frank eyes resting blankly on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you don't understand me,&rdquo; he went on. &ldquo;The God's truth is that I
      hain't no hand to talk about delicate matters to a young gal, an' you
      above all, but I want to <i>know</i>&mdash;I want <i>some'n''</i> to build
      on. I don't know how to put what I want to ax. Maybe I'm away&mdash;away
      off, an' will want to kill myse'f fer even dreamin' that&mdash;but&mdash;well,
      maybe you'll git at what I mean from this. You see, I run in the room on
      you an' my wife not long ago an' ketched Sally an' you a-cryin' over
      some'n' or other you'd confided to 'er, an' then other things of a like
      nature has crapped up lately, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you, Mr. Baker,&rdquo; said Cynthia, anxiously, when she saw
      he was going no further. &ldquo;I really don't. But I assure you, I'm ready to
      tell you anything.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah! Are you? Well, I started to say Sally don't cry over other folks'
      matters unless they are purty sad, an' you know at the time you refused to
      tell me what yore trouble was. Maybe you ain't ready yet, little sister.
      But could you tell me, right out plain, what ailed you that day?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stared and then dropped her glance to the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see that it would help in the matter,&rdquo; she said, awkwardly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe it wouldn't,&rdquo; he declared, in despair; &ldquo;an' I reckon thar are
      things one woman would tell another woman that she wouldn't speak of to a
      man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I guess that's so,&rdquo; said Cynthia, still perplexed over the turn the
      conversation had taken and yet firm in her determination to say nothing
      that would involve Mrs. Baker's secret.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, maybe you won't mind it much ef I put it this away,&rdquo; Pole
      continued. &ldquo;Now, remember, you don't have to say yes or no unless you want
      to. Little sister, I'll put it this away: ef Nelson Floyd was to never
      come back here again, could you, as&mdash;as a good, true woman&mdash;could
      you conscientiously marry another man? Could you with a clear conscience,
      I mean, before God, ever marry another man? Thar, it's out! Could you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia started. She looked down. She was silent. Her color rose.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now, mind,&rdquo; Pole said, suddenly, &ldquo;you don't <i>have</i> to answer unless
      you want to. No man's got a right to hem a weak, excited woman up in a
      corner and get at her heart's secrets.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would it do any good for you to know that, Mr. Baker?&rdquo; the girl said, in
      a low voice.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think so, little sister.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then&rdquo;&mdash;she turned her face away&mdash;&ldquo;I don't think I'd ever
      want to marry any other living man.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, my God!&rdquo; Pole averted his face, but not before she had seen its
      writhing torture. She stared at him in astonishment, and, to avoid her
      eyes, he lowered his head to his arms, which were folded on the top rail
      of the fence. Fully a minute passed; still he did not look up. She saw his
      broad shoulders rising and falling as if he were trying to subdue a
      torrent of emotion. She laid her hand firmly on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Tell me what you mean,&rdquo; she suddenly demanded. &ldquo;I want to know. This has
      gone far enough. What do you mean?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He raised a pair of great, blearing eyes to hers. He started to speak, but
      his voice hung in his throat. Tightening her clasp on his arm she repeated
      her demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see through it now,&rdquo; he found voice to say, huskily. &ldquo;I don't mean to
      say Nelson Floyd is afeard o' man, beast, nor devil when it comes to a <i>just</i>
      encounter, but he knows now that ef me an' him was to come face to face
      one of us ud have to die, an' he's man enough not to want to kill me in
      sech a cause. I gave 'im due warnin'. I told 'im the day he drove you to
      bush-arbor meetin' that ef he tuck advantage o' you I'd kill 'im as shore
      as God give me the strength. I knowed whar that stormy night was spent,
      but I refused to believe the wust. I give 'im the benefit o' that doubt,
      but now since you tell me with your own lips that&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh! Oh! <i>Oh!</i>&rdquo; The cry burst from her lips as if she were in sudden
      pain. &ldquo;I don't mean <i>that</i>. Why, I'm a <i>good</i> girl, Mr. Baker!
      I'm a good girl!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole leaned over the fence and laid his big, quivering hands on her
      shoulders. &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; he gulped, his eyes flashing with joy. &ldquo;Then I've
      still got my little sister an' I've got my friend. Thank God! thank God!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia stood for a moment with hanging head, and then with a deep sigh
      she turned to go away. He climbed over the fence and caught up with her,
      the light of a new fear now in his eyes, its fire in his quickened pulse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see you ain't never goin' to forgive me in the world fer sayin' what I
      did,&rdquo; he said, humbly; &ldquo;but God knows I wasn't thinkin' wrong o' you. It
      was him, damn 'im!&mdash;his hot-blooded natur', an' a lots o'
      circumstances that p'inted jest one way. I ain't more'n human, little
      sister, an' through that I've offended you beyond forgiveness.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A woman learns to bear a great many things,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &ldquo;My mother and
      others have hardened me so that I scarcely feel what you said as any other
      pure-minded woman might. Then&mdash;then&mdash;&rdquo; She faced him squarely,
      and her voice rang out sharply. &ldquo;We don't know&mdash;you don't&mdash;I
      don't know whether he is alive or&mdash;&rdquo; Her words failed her, a sob, dry
      and deep, shook her from head to foot. &ldquo;Don't curse him as you did just
      now, Mr. Baker; you may be cursing a dead man who, himself, was only
      human. But I know what he was&mdash;I saw his real and higher nature, and,
      as it struggled for growth in good and bad soil, it was the most beautiful
      flower God ever made. He can't be dead&mdash;he <i>must</i> not be dead. I&mdash;I
      could not bear that. Do you hear me? Call me what you will for my
      imprudent conduct with him, but don't admit that bare possibility for one
      instant&mdash;even in your thoughts. Don't do it, I say!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole gulped down his tense emotion. &ldquo;I'll tell you what I'll do, little
      sister,&rdquo; he proposed. &ldquo;Promise me you'll overlook what I said just now,
      an' I'll work these here hands&rdquo;&mdash;he held them up in the starlight&mdash;&ldquo;to
      the naked bone; I'll use this here brain&rdquo;&mdash;he struck his broad brow
      with a resounding slap&mdash;&ldquo;till it withers in the endeavor to fetch 'im
      back safe an' sound, ef you'll jest forgive me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Forgive you!&rdquo; She laughed harshly and tossed her head. &ldquo;That's already
      done. More than that, I want to tell you that I've always looked on you as
      a brother. You made me love you a long time ago by your gentleness and
      respect for women.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, little sister,&rdquo; Pole cried, &ldquo;I don't deserve that!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you do; but find him&mdash;find him, and bring him back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, little sister; I'll do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He stood still and watched her hurry away through the darkness.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Poor little trick,&rdquo; he sighed. &ldquo;I was countin' on that one thing to
      explain Nelson's absence. Since it ain't that, what the hell is it, unless
      he's been sandbagged down thar in Atlanta an' put out o' the way?&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was quite dark
      when Pole went into the cottage. There was a fire in the little
      sitting-room, and by its light he could see his wife through the open door
      of the next room as she quietly moved about. He paused in the door-way and
      whispered:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are the childern asleep, Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' tucked away.&rdquo; She came to him with a cautious step, and looked
      up into his face trustingly. &ldquo;Little Billy kept askin' fer papa, papa,
      papa! He said he jest wasn't goin' to sleep anywhar except in his own
      place in yore lap.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole went to the children's bed, looked down at the row of yellow heads
      for a moment, then suddenly bent and took the eldest boy into his arms.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You goose!&rdquo; Mrs. Baker exclaimed. &ldquo;I'm sorry I said what I did. You'll
      spile 'im to death. Thar, I knowed he'd wake up! It's jest what you
      wanted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you want yore papa?&rdquo; Pole said, in cooing tones of endearment. &ldquo;Well,
      Billy-boy, papa's got you, an' he ain't a-goin' to let no booger git you,
      nuther. Thar now, go back to sleep.&rdquo; And in a big arm-chair before the
      fire Pole sat and rocked back and forth with the child's head on his
      shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Whar've you been, papa?&rdquo; Billy asked, sliding his arm around Pole's
      rough, sunbrowned neck and pressing his face to his father's.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To feed the hogs, Billy-boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you never took so long before,&rdquo; argued the child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I had to watch 'em eat, Billy-boy&mdash;eat, eat, eat, Billy-boy! They
      hadn't had anything since mom-in' except roots, an' snags, an' pusley
      weeds, an' it was a purty sight to watch 'em stick the'r snouts in that
      slop. Now, go to sleep. Here we go&mdash;here we go&mdash;across the
      bridge to Drowsy Town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a moment the child was sleeping soundly and Pole bore him tenderly back
      to bed. As he straightened up in the darkened room his wife was beside
      him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I declare you are a <i>good</i> man,&rdquo; she said&mdash;&ldquo;the best-hearted,
      tenderest man in the world, Pole Baker!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He looked at her steadily for an instant, then he said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally, I want you to do me a special favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is it, Pole?&rdquo; Her voice was full of wonder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally, now don't laugh at me, but I want you to go put on a piece o' red
      ribbon, an' let yore hair hang down yore back loose like you used to. Fix
      it that away an' then come in to the fire.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, yo're foolish!&rdquo; Mrs. Baker was really pleased, and yet she saw no
      reason for his whim.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You do as I ax you, an' don't be long about it, nuther.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He turned back into the firelight, and, watching him cautiously from the
      adjoining room, Mrs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Baker saw him straightening out his shirt and brushing his coarse hair.
      Then, to her further surprise, she saw him take down his best coat from
      its peg on the wall and put it on. This was followed by a dusting of his
      rough shoes with a soiled, red handkerchief. In great wonder, Sally, with
      her hair loose on her shoulders, looked into the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You ain't in earnest about that&mdash;that red ribbon, are you, Pole?&rdquo;
       she faltered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am,&rdquo; he answered, without lifting his eyes from the fire. &ldquo;I mean
      exactly what I say.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, then, I'll do it, but I don't see a bit o' sense in it,&rdquo; she
      retorted. &ldquo;It's about our bedtime, an' I know in reason that we ain't
      a-goin' nowhar at this time o' night an' leave the childem by
      the'r-selves.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Still Pole did not look up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go an' do as I tell you,&rdquo; he repeated, a flush of growing
      embarrassment on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Mrs. Baker came in, even redder and more confused than he.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, what in the name o' common-sense&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      But he was gallantly placing a chair for her in front of the fire near his
      own. &ldquo;Take a seat,&rdquo; he said, bowing and motioning downward with his hands.
      &ldquo;When you stood in the door jest then, lookin' fer all the world like you
      did away back in our courtin'-day, I come as nigh as peas callin' you
      'Miss Sally.' Gee whiz! It's Mrs. Baker now&mdash;ain't it? How quar that
      sounds when a body looks back!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; she asked, as she sat down wonderingly, &ldquo;are you goin' some'rs at
      this time o' night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, it ain't that,&rdquo; he said, awkwardly&mdash;&ldquo;it ain't that, Sally. It
      ain't meetin', nor singin'-school, nor a moonlight buggy-ride.'Tain't none
      o' them old, old things.&rdquo; Pole crossed his long legs and leaned back in
      his chair. &ldquo;I know in reason that you are a-goin' to laugh at me, an' say
      I'm plumb crazy, but it's this away, Sally: some'n's jest happened that's
      set me to thinkin', an' it occurred to me that I wasn't half thankful
      enough to the Almighty fer all His many blessin's, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Baker was misled as to his meaning&mdash;&ldquo;somebody's
      been talkin' religion to you. You want to begin holdin' family prayer
      ag'in, I reckon. Now, looky' here, ef you do, I want you to keep it up. I
      feel wuss ever'time you start in an' break off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'Tain't that, nuther,&rdquo; Pole said, eying the red chunks under the
      fire-logs. &ldquo;Sally, thar ortn't to be no secret betwixt man an' wife. I had
      a talk with Cynthia Porter out at the hog-pen jest now about Nelson Floyd,
      an' the way she talked an' acted worked on me powerful. Seein' the way she
      feels about her sweetheart started me to thinkin' how awful I'd feel
      without you. An' with that come the feelin' that, somehow&mdash;somehow or
      other, Sally&mdash;me'n' you ain't jest pine-blank the way we used to be,
      an' I believe thar's a screw loose. I'd liter'ly die ef I didn't have you,
      an' I've been spittin' in the face o' Providence by the careless way I've
      been actin'. Now, Sally, I want you jest to set right thar, an' let's
      forget about them towheads in the next room, an' try an' forget all I've
      made you suffer fust an' last, an' let's git back&mdash;let's git back,
      Sally, to the old sweetheart-time. I know I'm tough, an' a sorry cuss
      before God an' man, but I've got the same heart a-beatin' in me to-night
      that was in me away back on Holly Creek. In this firelight you look as
      plump an' rosy an' bright-eyed as you did then, an' with that red ribbon
      at yore neck, an' yore hair down yore back, I feel&mdash;well, I feel like
      gittin' down on my knees an' beggin' you, like I did that time, not to
      take Jim Felton, but to give me a showin'. I wonder&rdquo;&mdash;Pole's voice
      broke, and he covered his mouth impulsively with his hand&mdash;&ldquo;I wonder
      ef it's too late to ax you to give me a chance to prove myself a good
      husband an' a father to them thar childern.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pole, stop!&rdquo; Mrs. Baker cried out, as if in pain. &ldquo;I won't let you
      set thar an' run yorese'f down, when you are the best-hearted man in this
      state. What is a little spree now an' then compared to the lot o' some
      pore women that git kicked an' cuffed, with never a tender word from the'r
      husbands. Pole, as the Lord is my judge, I kin honestly say that I&mdash;I
      almost want you <i>jest like you are</i>. Some men don't drink, but they
      hain't got yore heart an' gentle way, an' ef I had to take my choice over
      an' over ag'in, I'd choose a man like you every time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She rose suddenly, and with a face full of pent-up emotion she left the
      room. She returned in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I thought I heard the baby wakin',&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      He caught her hand and pulled her gently down into her chair. &ldquo;Yo're a
      liar, Sally,&rdquo; he said, huskily. &ldquo;You know yo're a-lyin'. You went out to
      wipe yore eyes. You didn't want me to see you cry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She made no denial, and he put his rough hand, with a reverent touch, on
      her hair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't quite as heavy as it was,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nor so fluffy. I reckon
      that's beca'se you keep it bound up so tight. When I fust tuck a shine to
      you, you used to run about them old hills as wild as a deer, an' the wind
      kept it tousled. Do you remember the day it got full o' cockleburs an' I
      tried to git 'em out? La me! I was all of a tremble. The Lord knows I
      never thought then that sech a sweet, scared, rosy little thing ud ever
      keep house fer me an' cook my grub an' be a mother to my childern. I never
      dreamt, then, that instead o' bein' grateful fer the blessin', I'd go off
      weeks at a time an' lie in a gutter, leavin' you to walk the floor in
      agony&mdash;sometimes with a nursin' baby an' not a scrap to eat. No, I
      never&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, Pole!&rdquo; With a sob, half of joy, half of sadness, Mrs. Baker put her
      hand over his mouth and pressed her face against his. &ldquo;Hush, hush, hush!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, thank God, I hope that day is over,&rdquo; he said, taking her hand from
      his lips. &ldquo;I've passed through a great crisis, Sally. Some'n' you don't
      know about&mdash;some'n' you may <i>never</i> know about&mdash;that
      happened right here in these mountains, but it may prove to be my
      turnin'-p'int.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      His wife looked uneasily at the fire. &ldquo;It's gittin' late, Pole,&rdquo; she said.
      &ldquo;We'd better go to bed.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      evening was balmy and moonlit. Hillhouse was at Porter's just after
      supper, seated on the porch in conversation with Mrs. Porter.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe I'd not ask her to see you to-night,&rdquo; she was advising
      him. &ldquo;The poor girl seems completely fagged out. She tries to do as much
      about the house as usual, but it seems to tire her more. Then she doesn't
      eat heartily, and I hear her constantly sighing.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see,&rdquo; Hillhouse said, despondently. &ldquo;Yes,&rdquo; the old woman pursued,
      &ldquo;I suppose if you finally get her to marry you, you'll have to put up with
      the memory that she <i>did</i> have a young girl's fancy for that man,
      Brother Hillhouse. But she wasn't the only one. The girls all liked him,
      and he did show a preference for her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has she&mdash;has she heard the latest news&mdash;the very latest?&rdquo;
       Hillhouse asked, anxiously. &ldquo;Has she heard the report that Henry A. Floyd
      told Mr. Mayhew he had met Nelson and revealed that awful news about his
      parentage?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; Mrs. Snodgrass came in with that report this morning. She knew as
      well as anything that Cynthia was excited, and yet she sat in the parlor
      and went over and over the worst parts of it, watching the girl like a
      hawk. Cynthia got up and left the room. She was white as death and looked
      like she would faint. Mrs. Snodgrass hinted at deliberate suicide. She
      declared a young man as proud and high-strung as Nelson Floyd would resort
      to that the first thing. She said she wouldn't blame him one bit after all
      he's suffered. Well, just think of it, Brother Hillhouse! Did you ever
      hear of anybody being treated worse? He's been tossed and kicked about all
      his life, constantly afraid that he wasn't quite as respectable as other
      folks. And then all at once he was taken up and congratulated by the
      wealth and blood around him on his high stand&mdash;and then finally had
      to have this last discovery rammed in his face. Why, that's enough to
      drive any proud spirit to desperation! I don't blame him for getting
      drunk. I don't blame him, either, for not wanting to come back to be
      snubbed by those folks. But what I <i>do</i> want is fer him not to drag
      me and mine into his trouble. When my girl marries, I want her to marry
      some man that will be good to her, and I want him to have decent social
      standing. Even if Floyd's alive, if I can help it, Cynthia shall never
      marry him&mdash;never!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Does Miss Cynthia believe,&rdquo; ventured the preacher, &ldquo;that Floyd has killed
      himself?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't think she believes that, <i>quite</i>,&rdquo; was Mrs. Porter's reply;
      &ldquo;but she doesn't seem to think he'll ever come back to Springtown. Don't
      you worry, Brother Hillhouse. She'll get over this shock after a while,
      and then she'll appreciate your worth and constancy. If I were you, I'd
      not press my claim right now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I wouldn't think of such a thing!&rdquo; Hillhouse stroked a sort of
      glowing resignation into his chin, upon which a two-days beard had made a
      ragged appearance. &ldquo;I've been awfully miserable, Sister Porter, but this
      talk with you has raised my hopes.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter rose with a faint smile.
      &ldquo;Now, you go home and write another good sermon like that last one. I
      watched Cynthia out of the corner of my eye all through it. That idea of
      its being our duty to bear our burdens cheerfully&mdash;no matter how
      heavy they are&mdash;seemed to do her a lot of good.&rdquo; The color came into
      Hillhouse's thin face, and his eyes shone. &ldquo;The sermon I have in mind for
      next Sunday is on the same general line,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm glad she listened.
      I was talking straight at her, Sister Porter. I'm not ashamed to admit it.
      I've been unable to think of anything but her since&mdash;since Floyd
      disappeared.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a good man, Brother Hillhouse&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter was giving him
      her hand&mdash;&ldquo;and somehow I feel like you will get all you want, in due
      time, remember&mdash;in due time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless you, sister,&rdquo; Hillhouse said, earnestly, and, pressing the old
      woman's hand, he turned away.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">W</span>HEN Cynthia heard
      the gate close behind the preacher, and from the window of her room had
      seen him striding away, she put a shawl over her shoulder and started out.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Where on earth are you going?&rdquo; her mother asked from the end of the
      porch, where she stood among the honeysuckle vines.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to run across to Mrs. Baker's, just a minute,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &ldquo;I
      won't be long. I'll come right back.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd think you'd be afraid to do that,&rdquo; her mother protested, &ldquo;with so
      many stray negroes about. Besides, it's the Bakers' bedtime. Can't you
      wait till to-morrow?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I want to walk, anyway,&rdquo; said Cynthia. &ldquo;I feel as if it will do me
      good. I'm not afraid.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I sha'n't go to bed till you come back,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter gave in.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes the girl was at the back-yard fence of Pole Baker's
      cottage. The door was open wide, and in the firelight Cynthia saw Mrs.
      Baker bending over the dining-room table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Mrs. Baker!&rdquo; the girl called, softly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who's that? Oh, it's you, Cynthia!&rdquo; and the older woman came out into the
      moonlight, brushing her white apron with her hand. She leaned over the
      fence. &ldquo;Won't you come in?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I promised mother I'd be right back. I thought maybe you could tell
      me if Mr. Baker had heard anything yet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sorry to say he hain't,&rdquo; replied the little woman, sadly. &ldquo;Him and
      Mr. Mayhew has been working all sorts of ways, and writing constant
      letters to detectives and the mayors of different cities, but everything
      has failed. He came in just now looking plumb downhearted.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia took a deep breath. Her lips quivered as if she had started to
      speak and failed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, la me! I haven't give up,&rdquo; Mrs. Baker said, in a tone of forced
      lightness. &ldquo;He'll come home all safe and sound one of these days, Cynthia.
      I have an idea that he's just mad at his ill-luck all round, and, right
      now, doesn't care what folks about here think. He'll git over all that in
      due time and come back and face his trouble like other men have done. It's
      a bitter pill fer a proud young man to swallow, but a body kin git used to
      most anything in time.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm afraid he's never coming home,&rdquo; Cynthia said, in rigid calmness. &ldquo;He
      once told me if he ever had any great trouble he would be tempted to drink
      again. Mr. Baker thinks he's been drinking, and in that condition there is
      no telling what has happened to him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, let me tell you some'n'&mdash;let me give you a piece of sound
      advice,&rdquo; said Mrs. Baker. &ldquo;It's unaxed; but I'm a sufferin' woman, an' I'm
      a-goin' to advise you as I see fit, ef you never speak to me ag'in. Ef
      whiskey is keepin' Nelson Floyd away, an' he does come back an' wants to
      marry you, don't you take 'im. Tear 'im from yore young heart 'fore the
      roots o' yore love git too big an' strong to pull out. It may not be
      whiskey that's keepin' 'im away. He may 'a' taken a dram or two at the
      start an' be livin' sober somewhar now; or, then ag'in, as you say,
      some'n' may 'a' happened to 'im; but, anyhow, don't you resk livin' with
      'im, not ef he has all the money on earth. Money won't stick to a drinkin'
      man no longer than the effects of a dram, an' in the mind of sech a fellow
      good intentions don't amount to no more than a swarm o' insects that are
      born an' die in a day. Of course, some men <i>do</i> reform. I'm prayin'
      right now that the awful thing that happened t'other night to Pole will be
      his tumin'-p'int, but I dunno. I'll walk on thin ice over a lake o' fire
      till I kin see furder. Be that as it may, Cynthia, I can't stand by an'
      see another unsuspectin' woman start in on the road I've travelled&mdash;no,
      siree!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think you are exactly right,&rdquo; Cynthia said, under her breath, and then
      she sighed deeply. &ldquo;Well, good-night. I must go.&rdquo; She was turning away,
      when Mrs. Baker called to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, Cynthia!&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;You ain't mad at me, are you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not a bit in the world,&rdquo; Cynthia answered. &ldquo;In fact, I'm grateful for
      your advice. I may never have a choice in such a matter, but I know you
      mean it for my own good.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As Cynthia entered the gate at home, her mother rose from a chair on the
      porch. &ldquo;Now I can go to bed,&rdquo; she remarked. &ldquo;I have been awfully uneasy,
      almost expecting to hear you scream out from that lonely meadow.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There was nothing to be afraid of, mother,&rdquo; and Cynthia passed on to her
      own room. She closed the door and lighted her lamp, and then took her
      Bible from the top drawer of her bureau and sat down at her table and
      began to read it. She read chapter after chapter mechanically, her
      despondent eyes doing work which never reached her throbbing brain.
      Presently she realized this and closed the book. Rising, she went to her
      window and looked across the grass-grown triangle to her mother's window.
      It was dark. All the other windows were so, too. The house was wrapped in
      slumber. She heard the clock strike nine. Really she must go to bed, and
      yet she knew she would not sleep, and the thought of the long, conscious
      hours till daybreak caused her to shudder.
    </p>
    <p>
      Perhaps twenty minutes had passed since the clock struck, when a sound
      suddenly fell upon her ears that thrilled every muscle in her body. It was
      the far-off call of a whippoorwill! Was it the cry of the real bird or an
      imitation&mdash;<i>his</i> imitation? She stood like a thing of stone,
      straining her ears for its repetition. There! There it was again, and
      nearer, clearer, more appealing. Ah, no creature of mere feathers and
      flesh could have uttered that tentative, soulful note! It was Nelson Floyd
      alive!&mdash;alive and wanting her&mdash;her first of all! Standing before
      her mirror, she tried to tie up her hair, which had fallen loose upon her
      shoulders, but her hands refused to do their office. Without a second's
      deliberation she sprang to her door, opened it, and ran on to the outer
      one. Passing through this, she glided across the porch and softly sped
      over the grass in the direction of the sound. She heard it again, in
      startling shrillness, and then, in the clear moonlight, she saw Floyd
      standing in front of the grape-arbor. As she drew near her heart stood
      still at the sight of the change which had come on him. It lay like the
      tracing of Death's pencil on his brow, in his emaciated features and
      loosely fitting, soiled, and unpressed clothing. For the first time in her
      life she yielded herself without resistance to his out-stretched arms.
      With no effort to prevent it, she allowed him to press his lips to hers.
      Childlike, and as if in fear of losing him again, she slid her arm round
      his neck and drew him tightly to her. Neither uttered a word. Thus they
      remained for a moment, and then he led her into the arbor and they sat
      down together, his arm still about her body, her head on his breast. He
      was first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was so afraid you'd not come,&rdquo; he panted, as if he had been walking
      fast. &ldquo;Have you heard of my trouble?&rdquo; he went on, his voice sounding
      strange and altered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She nodded on his breast, not wanting to see the pain she knew was
      mirrored in his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no, surely you haven't&mdash;that is, not&mdash;not what I learned in
      Atlanta about my&mdash;my mother and father?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Again she nodded, pressing her brow upward against his chin in a mute
      action of consolation and sympathy.
    </p>
    <p>
      He sighed. &ldquo;I didn't think anybody knew that,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;That is, anybody
      up here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mr. Mayhew went down and saw your uncle,&rdquo; Cynthia found voice to say,
      finally.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't call him my uncle&mdash;he's not that, except as hell gives men
      relatives. But I don't want to speak of him. The memory of his ashy face,
      glittering eyes, and triumphant tone as he hurled those facts at me is
      like a horrible nightmare. I'm not here to deny a thing, little girl. I
      came to let you see me just as I am. I fell very low. No one knows I'm
      here. I passed through Darley without meeting a soul I knew and walked all
      the way here, dodging off the road when I heard the sound of hoofs or
      wheels. I've come to you, Cynthia&mdash;only you. You are the only one out
      of this part of my life that I ever want to see again. I am not going to
      hide anything. After that revelation in Atlanta I sank as low as a brute.
      I drank and lost my head. I spent several days in New Orleans more like a
      demon than a human being&mdash;among gamblers, thieves, and cutthroats.
      Two of my companions confessed to me that they were escaped convicts put
      in for murder. I went on to Havana and came back again to New Orleans.
      Yesterday I reached Atlanta. I learned that the police had been trying to
      find me, and hid out. Last night, Cynthia, I was drunk again; but this
      morning I woke up with a longing to throw it all off, to be a man once
      more, and while I was thinking about it a thought came to me like a flash
      of light from heaven thrown clear across the black waste of hell. The
      thought came to me that, although I am a nobody (that name has never
      passed my lips since I learned it was not my own)&mdash;the thought came
      to me, I say, that there was one single and only chance for me to return
      to manhood and obtain earthly happiness. Do you follow me, dearest?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She raised her head and looked into his great, staring eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not quite, Nelson,&rdquo; she said, softly. &ldquo;Not quite.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see, I recalled that you, too, are not happy here at home, and, as in
      my case, through no fault of your own&mdash;no fault, except being born
      different from others around you. I remembered all you'd told me about
      your mother's suspicious, exacting nature, and how hard you worked at
      home, and how little real joy you got out of life, and then it came to me
      that we both had as much right to happiness as any one else&mdash;you for
      your hard life and I for all that I'd suffered. So I stopped drinking. I
      have not touched a drop to-day, although a doctor down there said I really
      needed a stimulant. You can see how nervous I am. I shake all over. But I
      am stimulated by hope&mdash;that's it, Cynthia&mdash;hope! I've come to
      tell you that you can make a man of me&mdash;that you have it in your
      power to blot out all my trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't see how, Nelson.&rdquo; Cynthia raised her head and looked into his
      shadowy face wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've come here to ask you to leave this spot with me forever. I've got
      unlimited means. Even since I've been away my iron lands in Alabama and
      coal lands in Tennessee have sprung up marvellously in value. This
      business here at the store is a mere trifle compared to other investments
      of mine. We could go far away where no one knows of my misfortune, and,
      hand-in-hand, make us a new home and new friends. Oh, Cynthia, that holds
      out such dazzling promise to me that, honestly, all the other fades away
      in contrast to it. Just to think, you'll be all mine, all mine&mdash;alone
      with me in the wide, wide world! I have no legal name to give you, it's
      true, but&rdquo;&mdash;he laughed harshly&mdash;&ldquo;we could put our heads together
      and pick a pretty one, and call ourselves by it. I once knew a man who was
      a foundling, and because they picked him up early in the morning he was
      called 'Early.' That wouldn't sound bad, would it? Mr. and Mrs. Early,
      from nowhere, but nice, good people. What do you say, little girl? It all
      rests with you now. You are to decide whether I rise or sink back again,
      for God knows I don't see how I could possibly give you up. I have not
      acted right with you all along in not declaring my love sooner, but I
      hardly knew my mind. It was not till that night at the mill that I began
      to realize how dear you were to me, but it was such a wonderful awakening
      that I did not speak of it as I should. But why don't you say something,
      Cynthia? Surely you don't love any one else&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She drew herself quite from his embrace, but, still clasping one of his
      hands like an eager child, she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nelson, I don't believe I'm foolish and impetuous like some girls I know.
      You are asking me to take the most important step in a woman's life, and I
      cannot decide hastily. You have been drinking, Nelson, you acknowledge
      that frankly. In fact, I would have known it anyway, for you are not like
      you used to be&mdash;even your voice has altered. Nelson, a man who will
      give way to whiskey even in great trouble is not absolutely a safe man.
      I'm unhappy, I'll admit it. I've suffered since you disappeared as I never
      dreamed a woman could suffer, and yet&mdash;and yet what you propose seems
      a very imprudent thing to do. When did you want me to leave?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A week from to-night,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I can have everything ready by then and
      will bring a horse and buggy. I'll leave them down below the orchard and
      meet you right here. I'll whistle in the old way, and you must come to me.
      For God's sake don't refuse. I promise to grant any request you make. Not
      a single earthly wish of yours shall ever go unsatisfied. I <i>know</i> I
      can make you happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was silent for a moment. She drew her hand from his clasp. &ldquo;I'll
      promise this much,&rdquo; she said, in a low, firm voice. &ldquo;I'll promise to bring
      my decision here next Friday night. If I decide to go, I suppose I'd
      better pack&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Only a very few things,&rdquo; he interposed. &ldquo;We shall stop in New Orleans and
      you can get all you want. Oh, little girl, think of my sheer delight over
      seeing you fairly loaded down with the beautiful things you ought always
      to have had, and noting the wonder of everybody over your rare beauty of
      face and form, and to know that you are all mine, that you gave up
      everything for a nameless man! You will not go back on me, dearest? You
      won't do it, after all I've been through?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia was silent after this burst of feeling, and he put his arm around
      her and drew her, slightly resisting, into his embrace.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is troubling you, darling?&rdquo; he asked, tenderly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm worried about your drinking,&rdquo; she faltered. &ldquo;I've seen more misery
      come from that habit than anything else in the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I swear to you that not another drop shall ever pass my lips,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;Why, darling, even with no promise to you to hold me back, I
      voluntarily did without it to-day, when right now my whole system is
      crying out for it and almost driving me mad. If I could do that of my own
      accord, don't you see I could let it alone forever for your sake?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But&rdquo;&mdash;Cynthia raised her eyes to his&mdash;&ldquo;between now and&mdash;and
      next Friday night, will you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall be as sober as a judge when I come,&rdquo; he laughed, absorbing hope
      from her question. &ldquo;I shall come to you with the clearest head I ever had&mdash;the
      clearest head and the lightest heart, little girl, for we are going out
      together into a great, mysterious, dazzling world. You will not refuse me?
      You are sent to me to repay me for all I've been through. That's the way
      Providence acts. It brings us through misery and shadows out into joy and
      light. My shadows have been dark, but my light&mdash;great God, did mortal
      ever enter light such as ours will be!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll decide by next Friday night,&rdquo; Cynthia said; &ldquo;that's all I can
      promise now. It is a most important matter and I shall give it a great
      deal of thought. I see the way you look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But, Cynthia,&rdquo; he cautioned her, &ldquo;don't tell a soul that I've been here.
      They think I'm dead; let them continue to do so. Friday night just leave a
      note saying that you have gone off with me and that you will write the
      particulars later. But we won't write till we have put a good many miles
      behind us. Your mother' will raise a lot of fuss, but we can't help that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not mention it to any one,&rdquo; the girl agreed, and she rose and
      stood before him, half turned to go.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then kiss me, dearest,&rdquo; he pleaded, seizing her hands and holding them
      tight&mdash;&ldquo;kiss me of your own accord; you know you never have done
      that, not even once, since I've known you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; don't ask me to do that,&rdquo; she said, firmly, &ldquo;for that would be
      absolute consent, and I tell you, Nelson, frankly, I have not yet fully
      decided. You must not build on it too much.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, don't talk that way, darling. Don't let me carry a horrible doubt for
      a whole week. Do say something that will keep up my hopes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All I can say is that I'll decide by Friday night,&rdquo; she repeated. &ldquo;And if
      I go I shall be ready. Good-night, Nelson; I can't stay out longer.&rdquo; He
      walked with her as far as he could safely do so in the direction of the
      farm-house, and then they parted without further words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She'll go&mdash;the dear little thing,&rdquo; he said to himself,
      enthusiastically, as he walked through the orchard. When he had climbed
      over the fence he paused, looked back, and shrugged his shoulders. An
      unpleasant thrill passed over him. It was the very spot on which he had
      met Pole Baker that night and had been so soundly reprimanded for his
      indiscretion in quitting Nathan Porter's premises in such a stealthy
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Floyd pressed his hand to his waistcoat-pocket and drew out a
      tiny object that glittered in the moonlight. &ldquo;The engagement ring!&rdquo; he
      exclaimed, in a tone of deep disappointment; &ldquo;and I forgot to give it to
      her. What a fool I was, when she's never had a diamond in her life! Well&rdquo;&mdash;he
      looked hesitatingly towards the farm-house&mdash;&ldquo;it wouldn't do to call
      her back now. I'll keep it till Friday night. Like an idiot, I forgot,
      too, in my excitement, to tell her where we are to be married&mdash;that
      is, if she will go; but she won't desert me&mdash;I can trust her. She
      will be my wife&mdash;<i>my wife!</i>&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE next morning,
      after breakfast, Mrs. Porter told her husband to harness the horse and
      hitch him to the buggy. &ldquo;I've got some butter ready to sell,&rdquo; she
      explained, &ldquo;and some few things to buy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll gain lots by it,&rdquo; Nathan sneered, as he reluctantly proceeded to
      do her bidding. &ldquo;In the fust place it will take yore time fer half a day,
      the hoss's time fer half a day, an' the wear an' tear on the buggy will
      amount to more than all you git fer the butter. But that's the way women
      calculate. They can't see an inch 'fore the'r noses.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can see far enough before mine to hear you grumbling at dinner about
      the coffee being out,&rdquo; she threw back at him; &ldquo;something you, with all
      your foresight, forgot yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, I reckon the old lady did hit me that pop!&rdquo; Nathan admitted to
      himself as he walked away. &ldquo;Fust thing I know I'll not be able to open my
      mouth&mdash;women are gittin' so dern quick on the trigger&mdash;an', by
      gum, I <i>did</i> forgit that coffee, as necessary as the stuff is to my
      comfort.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Porter brought the horse and buggy around a few minutes later his
      wife was ready on the porch with her pail of neatly packed butter. Cynthia
      came to the door, but her mother only glanced at her coldly as she took up
      her pail and climbed into the vehicle and grasped the reins.
    </p>
    <p>
      Reaching Mayhew &amp; Floyd's store, she went in and showed the butter to
      Joe Peters, who stood behind one of the counters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want eighteen cents a pound,&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;If towns-people won't pay it,
      they can't eat <i>my</i> butter. Butter for less than that is white and
      puffy and full of whey.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did you want in exchange for it, Mrs. Porter?&rdquo; the clerk asked. &ldquo;In
      trade, you know, we do better than for cash.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want its worth in coffee,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;that's all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We'll take it, then, and be glad to get it,&rdquo; Peters said, and he put the
      firm, yellow lumps on the scales, made a calculation with a pencil on a
      piece of wrapping-paper, and began to put up the coffee. Meanwhile, she
      looked about her. Mayhew sat at a table in the rear. The light from a
      window beyond him, falling on his gray head, made it look like a bunch of
      cotton.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon he's keeping his own books now that Nelson Floyd's away?&rdquo; she
      said, interrogatively, to the busy clerk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A body mought call it book-keepin',&rdquo; Peters laughed, &ldquo;but it's all I can
      do to make out his scratchin'. He writes an awful fist. The truth is, we
      are terribly upset by Floyd's absence, Mrs. Porter. His friends&mdash;folks
      that like 'im&mdash;come fer forty miles, clean across the Tennessee line,
      to trade with him, and when they don't see him about they go on with empty
      wagons to Darley. It's mighty nigh runnin' the old man crazy. He sees now
      who was butterin' his bread. Ef Nelson was to come back now the old cuss
      'ud dress 'im out in purple an' fine linen an' keep 'im in a glass case.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you expect Floyd to come back?&rdquo; Mrs. Porter was putting the damp
      napkin back into her empty pail. Indifference lay in her face and voice
      but had not reached her nervous fingers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Porter&rdquo;&mdash;Peters spoke lower. He came around the counter and
      joined her on the threshold of the door&mdash;&ldquo;I'm a-goin' to let you on
      to some'n' that I'm afeard to tell even the old man. The Lord knows I
      wouldn't have Mrs. Snodgrass an' her team git hold of it fer the world.
      You see, ef I was to talk too much I mought lose my job. Anyway, I don't
      want to express an opinion jest on bare suspicion, but I know you've got a
      silent tongue in yore head, an' I think I know, too, why yo're interested,
      an' I'm in sympathy with you an'&mdash;an' Miss&mdash;an' with all
      concerned, Mrs. Porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You said you were going to tell me something,&rdquo; the old woman reminded
      him, her glance on the court-house across the street, her voice tense,
      probing, and somewhat resentful of his untactful reference to Cynthia.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm a-goin' to tell you this much,&rdquo; said Peters, &ldquo;but it's in strict
      confidence, Mrs. Porter. Thar has been a lot o' letters fer Floyd on all
      sorts o' business affairs accumulatin' here. Mayhew's been openin' 'em all
      an' keepin' 'em in a stack in a certain pigeon-hole of the desk. Now, I
      seed them letters thar jest last night when I closed the store, an' this
      mornin' early, when I opened up an' was sweepin' out, I missed 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I see!&rdquo; exclaimed Mrs. Porter, impulsively. &ldquo;Well, ef you do, you see
      more'n me,&rdquo; Peters went on, &ldquo;fer I don't know how it happened. It's
      bothered me all day. You see, I can't talk to the old man about it, fer
      maybe he come down here some time last night an' got 'em fer some purpose
      or other. An' then ag'in&mdash;well, thar is jest three keys to the house,
      Mrs. Porter, the one the old man has, the one I tote, an' the one Nelson
      Floyd tuck off with 'im.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you have an idea that maybe&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hain't no idea about it, I tell you, Mrs. Porter, unless&mdash;unless
      Nelson Floyd come back here last night an' come in the store an' got his
      mail.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you think he may be back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know that he is, you understand, but I'm a-goin' to hope that he
      ain't dead, Mrs. Porter. Ef thar ever was a man I loved&mdash;that is to
      say, downright <i>loved</i>&mdash;it was Nelson Floyd. La me! I could
      stand here from now till sundown an' not git through tellin' you the
      things he's done in my behalf. You remember&mdash;jest to mention one&mdash;that
      mother had to be tuck to Atlanta to Dr. Winston to have a cancer cut out.
      Well, she had no means, an' I didn't, an' we was in an awful plight&mdash;her
      jest cryin' an' takin' on day an' night in the fear o' death. Well, Nelson
      got onto it. He drawed me off behind the store one day&mdash;as white as a
      sheet, bless your soul! fer it mighty nigh scared the boy to death to be
      ketched at his good acts&mdash;an' he up an' told me he was goin' to pay
      the whole bill, but that I mustn't tell nobody, an' I wouldn't tell you
      now ef mean reports wasn't out agin 'im. I hardly knowed what to do, fer I
      didn't want to be beholden to 'im to sech a great extent, but he made me
      take the money, an', as you know, mother got well ag'in. Then what did he
      do but raise my wages away up higher than any clerk in this part o' the
      state gits. That mighty nigh caused a split betwixt him an' the old man,
      but Nelson had his way. I tried to pay some on the debt, but he wouldn't
      take it. He wouldn't even let me give 'im my note; he'd always laugh an'
      turn it off, an' of late it sorter made 'im mad, an' I simply had to quit
      talkin' about it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He had his good side.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter yielded the point significantly. &ldquo;I
      never denied that. But a man that does good deeds half the time and bad
      half the time gets a chance to do a sort of evil that men with worse
      reputations don't run across.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter moved away towards her buggy,
      and then she came back, and, looking him straight in the eye, she said, &ldquo;I
      hardly think, Joe, the fact that those letters are missing proves that
      Nelson Floyd was here last night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't think so, Mrs. Porter?&rdquo; Peters' face fell.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No; Mr. Mayhew no doubt took them to look over. I understand he and Pole
      Baker are trying to get track of Floyd. You see, they may have hoped to
      get some clew from the letters.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's a fact, Mrs. Porter,&rdquo; and, grown quite thoughtful, the clerk was
      silent as he helped her into her buggy.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; she said to herself, as she started off.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Floyd's done a lot o' good deeds, has he? I've known men to act like
      angels to set their consciences at rest after conduct that would make the
      bad place itself turn pink in shame. I know your kind, Nelson Floyd, and a
      little of you goes a long way.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">M</span>RS. PORTER drove
      down the village street between the rows of scattered houses till she
      arrived at a modest cottage with a white paling fence in front and a few
      stunted flowers. Here she alighted. There was a hitching-post, with an old
      horseshoe nailed near the top for a hook, and, throwing the reins over it,
      she went into the yard. Some one came to a window and parted the curtains.
      It was Hillhouse. He turned and stepped quickly to the door, a startled
      expression of inquiry on his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Really, I wasn't looking for anybody to drop
      in so early in the day; and this is the first time you've ever called,
      Sister Porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      With a cold nod she walked past him into the little white-walled,
      carpetless hall.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You've got a parlor, haven't you?&rdquo; she asked, cautiously looking around.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes; excuse me,&rdquo; he stammered, and he awkwardly opened a door on the
      right. &ldquo;Walk in, walk in. I'm awfully rattled this morning. Seeing you so
      sudden made me&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I hope the Marshall family across the street weren't watching as I got
      out,&rdquo; she broke in, as she preceded him into the parlor. &ldquo;People talk so
      much here, and I wanted to see you privately. Let a woman with a grown
      daughter go to an unmarried preacher's house and you never hear the last
      of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down in a rocking-chair and looked about her, he thought, with an
      expression of subdued excitement. The room was most simply furnished. On
      the floor lay a rag carpet, with rugs of the same material. A cottage
      organ stood in one corner, and a round, marble-topped table in the centre
      of the room held a lamp and a plush-covered album. On the white walls hung
      family portraits, black-and-white enlarged photographs. The window looking
      towards the street had a green shade and white, stiffly starched lace
      curtains..
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your mother and sister&mdash;are they in the house?&rdquo; Mrs. Porter asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No,&rdquo; he answered, standing in front of her. &ldquo;They went over to McGill's
      as soon as breakfast was finished. You know their little boy got kicked by
      a mule yesterday.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I heard so, and I'm glad they are not here&mdash;though you'd better
      tell them I came. If you don't, and the Marshalls happen to mention it to
      them, they might think it strange.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You wanted to see me alone, then?&rdquo; Hillhouse put out his stiff, tentative
      hand and drew a chair to him and sat down in it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm in trouble&mdash;great, great trouble,&rdquo; the old woman said, her
      steely glance on his face; &ldquo;and to tell you the truth, I don't see how I'm
      going to get around it. I couldn't mention it to any one else but you, not
      even Nathan nor mother. In fact, you ought to know, for it's bound to
      worry you, too.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sister Porter, what is it? Don't keep me waiting. I knew you were in
      some trouble when I saw your face as you came in at the gate. Is it about&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course it's about Cynthia,&rdquo; sighed the woman&mdash;&ldquo;about her and
      Nelson Floyd.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's dead, and she&mdash;&rdquo; Hillhouse began, but Mrs. Porter stopped him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that isn't it,&rdquo; she went on. &ldquo;He's alive. He's back here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, is that so?&rdquo; Hillhouse leaned forward, his face white, his thin lips
      quivering.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'll tell you about it,&rdquo; went on Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;Of late I've been
      unable to sleep for thinking of Cynthia and her actions, she's seemed so
      reckless and despondent, and last night I left my bed and started to creep
      in and see if she was asleep. I had on soft slippers and made no noise,
      and had just got to the end of the hall, when her door opened and she went
      out at the front.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gone? Oh, don't&mdash;don't tell me that, Mrs. Porter!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, not that, quite; but wait till I am through,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, her
      tone hard and crisp. &ldquo;When I got to the porch I saw her just disappearing
      in the orchard. And then I heard somebody whistling like a whippoorwill.
      It was Nelson Floyd. He was standing at the grape-arbor, and the two met
      there. They went inside and sat down, and then, as there was a thick row
      of rose-bushes between the house and the arbor, I slipped up behind it. I
      crouched down low till I was almost flat on the ground. I heard every word
      that passed between them.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillhouse said nothing. The veins in his forehead stood out full and dark.
      Drops of perspiration, the dew of mental agony, appeared on his cheeks.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't form hasty judgment,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said. &ldquo;If I ever doubted, or
      feared my child's weakness on that man's account, I don't now. She's as
      good and pure as the day she was born. In fact, I don't believe she would
      have gone out to meet him that way if she hadn't been nearly crazy over
      the uncertainty as to what had happened to him. I don't blame her; I'd
      have done it myself if I'd cared as much for a man as she does about him&mdash;or
      thinks she does.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you heard what passed?&rdquo; Hillhouse panted.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and never since I was born have I heard such stuff as he poured into
      that poor child's ears. As I listened to his talk, one instant my heart
      would bleed with sympathy and the next I'd want to grab him by the throat
      and strangle him. He was all hell and all heaven's angels bound up in one
      human shape to entrap one frail human being. He went over all his
      suffering from babyhood up, saying he had had as much put on him as he
      could stand. He had come back by stealth and didn't want a soul but her to
      know he was here; he didn't intend ever to face the sneers of these folks
      and let them throw up his mother's sin to him. He'd been on a long and
      terrible debauch, but had sobered up and promised to stay that way if she
      would run away with him to some far-off place where no soul would ever
      know his history. He had no end of funds, he said; he'd made money on
      investments outside of Springtown, and he promised to gratify every wish
      of hers. She was to have the finest and best in the land, and get away
      from a miserable existence under my roof. Oh, I hate him&mdash;poisoning
      her mind against the mother who nursed her!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He wanted her to elope!&rdquo; gasped Hillhouse&mdash;&ldquo;to elope with a man just
      off of a long drunk and with a record like that behind him&mdash;<i>her</i>,
      that beautiful, patient child! But what did she say?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;At first she refused to go, as well as I could make out, and then she
      told him she would have to think over it. He is to meet her at the same
      place next Friday night, and if she decides to go between now and then she
      will be ready.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, we've discovered it ahead of time!&rdquo; Hillhouse said, fervently,
      and he got up, and, with his head hanging low and his bony hands clutched
      behind him over the tails of his long, black coat, he walked back and
      forth from the window to the door. &ldquo;I tell you, Sister Porter,&rdquo; he almost
      sobbed, &ldquo;I can't give her up to him. I can't, I tell you. It isn't in me.
      I'd die rather than have her go off with him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So would I&mdash;so would I, fearin' what I <i>now</i> do,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter
      said, without looking at him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>Fearing what you now do?</i>&rdquo; Hillhouse paused in front of her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's what I said.&rdquo; The old woman raised her eyes to his. Hillhouse sank
      down into his chair, nursing a new-born alarm in his lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you mean, Sister Porter?&rdquo; he asked, in a low tone.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I mean that I never heard any thoroughly rational man on earth talk
      just as Floyd did last night. I may be away off. I may be wronging him
      badly, but not once in all his tirade did he say <i>right in so many words</i>
      that he meant actually to marry her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God, the damnable wretch!&rdquo; Hillhouse sprang again to his feet. Mrs.
      Porter put out her hand and caught his arm and drew him down to his chair
      again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't decide hastily,&rdquo; she urged him. &ldquo;I laid awake all night trying to
      get it clear in my head. He had lots to say about the awful way the world
      had treated him, and that he felt, having no name, that he was unworthy of
      anybody as sweet and good as she was, but that if she would go off with
      him he'd feel that she had sacrificed everything for him and that that
      would recompense him for all he had lost. He even said that Providence
      sometimes worked that way, giving people a lot to bear at first, and then
      lifting them out of it all of a sudden.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillhouse leaned forward till his elbows rested on his knees and he
      covered his ghastly face with his hands. For a moment he was silent. Mrs.
      Porter could hear him breathing heavily. Suddenly he looked at her from
      eyes that were almost bloodshot.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;<i>I</i> understand him,&rdquo; he declared. &ldquo;He fell into a drunkard's hell,
      feeling that he was justified in such a course by his ill-luck, and now he
      has deliberately persuaded himself that both he and she would be justified
      in defying social customs&mdash;being a law unto themselves as it were. It
      is just the sort of thing a man of his erratic character would think of,
      and the damnable temptation is so dazzling that he is trying to make
      himself believe they have a right to it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Really, that was what I was afraid of,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, with a soft
      groan. &ldquo;I heard him tell her that he would never be called by the name of
      Floyd again. Surely, a man has to have a name of some sort to get legally
      married, doesn't he?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course he has,&rdquo; said Hillhouse. &ldquo;But, my God, Sister Porter, what are
      you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the trouble,&rdquo; answered the old woman. &ldquo;I understand Cynthia well
      enough to know that she will not be coerced in the matter. She is going to
      think it all over, and if she decides to go with him no power on earth
      will stop her. She looks already better satisfied. The only thing I can
      see is for me to try to stir up her sympathies in some way. She's
      tender-hearted; she'd hate to be the cause of my suffering. We must work
      together, and in secret, Brother Hillhouse.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Work together, but how?&rdquo; the preacher groaned. &ldquo;I can't think of a thing
      to do. If I appealed to her on the score of my love for her she would only
      balance that off by his, and all she imagines the scoundrel suffers.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, his trouble is <i>real</i> enough,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter declared. &ldquo;I tell you
      that in spite of my hatred for him, and even in spite of his cowardly
      insinuations against me ringing in my ears last night, I felt sorry for
      him. It would pierce a heart of stone to hear him talk as he did to her.
      If she resists, she will be a stronger woman than I would have been at her
      age and under the same circumstances. Pshaw! what would I have cared if
      I'd loved a man with all my heart and fate had deprived him of a name to
      give me&mdash;what would I have cared for the opinions of a little handful
      of people pent up here in the mountains when he was asking me to go with
      him out into the wide world and take my chances along with him? I don't
      know, Brother Hillhouse, but that I'd have gloried in the opportunity to
      say I was no better than he was. That's the way most women would look at
      it; that's the way, I'm afraid, <i>she</i> will look at it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The preacher turned upon her, cold fury snapping in his eyes and voice.
      &ldquo;You talk that way&mdash;<i>you!</i>&rdquo; he snarled&mdash;&ldquo;and you her
      mother! You are almost arguing that because <i>his</i> father and mother
      branded him as they did that he and Cynthia have a right to&mdash;to brand
      their&mdash;their own helpless offspring the same way. Sin can't be
      compromised with.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, you are right. I wasn't looking far enough ahead,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter
      acknowledged. &ldquo;No, we must save her. Heaven could not possibly bless such
      a step as that. I want her to hear somebody talk on that line. Say,
      Brother Hillhouse, if I can get her to come to church to-morrow, could you
      not, in a roundabout way, touch on that idea?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I am willing to try anything&mdash;anything!&rdquo; the minister
      said, despondently. &ldquo;Yes, bring her, if she will come. She seems to listen
      to me. I'll do my best.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll bring her,&rdquo; Mrs. Sorter promised. &ldquo;Good-morning. I'd better
      get back. They will wonder what's keeping me.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">F</span>OR midsummer, the
      next morning was clear and cool. Nathan Porter rolled the family
      spring-wagon down to the creek and washed off the wheels and greased the
      axles.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your pa's getting ready to drive us to church, Cynthia,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter
      adroitly said to the girl as she was removing the dishes from the table in
      the diningroom. &ldquo;I wish you'd go with me. I hate to sit there with just
      your pa.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was an instant's hesitation visible in Cynthia's sudden pause in her
      work and the startled lift of her eyebrows. Then she said:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, mother, if you want me to, I'll go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, then, go get out your white muslin and flowered hat. They become
      you more than anything you wear.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Without further words Cynthia left the room, and Mrs. Porter walked out
      into the hall and stood in the front door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Somehow, I imagine,&rdquo; she mused, &ldquo;that she was thinking it would be her
      last time at our church. I don't know what makes me think so, but she had
      exactly that look in her face. I do wish I could go in and tell mother all
      about it, but she's too old and childish to act with caution. I can't go
      to Nathan, either, for he'd laugh at me; he'd not only do that, but he'd
      tell it all over the country and drive Cynthia to meet Floyd ahead of
      time. No, no; I must do the best I can with Mr. Hillhouse's help. He loves
      her; he'd make her a good, safe husband, too, while that dare-devil would
      most likely tire of her in a short time, and take to drinking and leave
      her high and dry in some far-off place. No, Floyd won't do to risk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The service was not well attended that morning, owing to a revival in
      progress at Darley. Reports of the good music and high religious
      excitement had drawn away a goodly number of Hillhouse's parishioners.
      But, considering the odd nature of the discourse he had planned, this was
      perhaps in the young preacher's favor. Indeed, as he sat in his
      high-backed chair behind the little wooden stand, which held a ponderous
      open Bible, a glass pitcher of water, and a tumbler, Mrs. Porter, as she
      and Cynthia entered and took their usual places, thought he looked as if
      he had not slept the preceding night. His skin was yellow, his hair stood
      awry, and his eyes had a queer, shifting expression. Had his wily old ally
      doubted that he intended to fulfil his promise to publicly touch on the
      matter so near to them both, she could do so no longer after he had risen
      and stood unconsciously swaying from side to side, as he made some formal
      announcements in harsh, rigid tones. Indeed, he had the appearance of a
      man who could have talked of only one thing, thought of only one thing,
      that to which his whole being was nailed. His subject was that of the sins
      of the fathers being visited upon their children, even to the third and
      fourth generations. And Mrs. Porter shrank guiltily as his almost
      desperate voice rang out in the still room How was it possible for those
      around not to suspect&mdash;to know&mdash;that she had instigated the
      sermon and brought her unsuspecting child there to be swerved by it from
      the dangerous course she was pursuing? In former sermons Hillhouse had
      unfailingly allowed his glance to rest on Cynthia's face, but on this
      occasion he looked everywhere but at her. As he proceeded, he seemed to
      take on confidence in his theme; his tone rose high, clear, and firm, and
      quivered in the sheer audacity of his aim. He showed, from that lesson,
      the serious responsibility resting on each individual&mdash;each
      prospective mother and father. Then, all at once, it dawned on the
      congregation that Floyd's misfortune had inspired the discourse, and each
      man and woman bent breathlessly forward that they might not lose a word.
      The picture was now most clear to their intelligences. And seeing that
      they understood, and were sympathetically following him, Hillhouse swept
      on, the bit of restraint between his clinched teeth, to direct, personal
      reference.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;We can take it home to ourselves, brothers and sisters,&rdquo; he went on,
      passionately. &ldquo;Even in our own humble, uneventful lives here in the
      mountains, out of the great current of worldliness that flows through the
      densely populated portions of our land, we have seen a terrible result of
      this failure of man to do his duty to his posterity. Right here in our
      midst the hand of God has fallen so heavily that the bright hopes of
      sterling youth are crushed out completely. There was here among us a fine
      specimen of mental and physical manhood, a young soul full of hope and
      ambition. There was not a ripple on the calm surface of that life, not a
      cloud in the clear sky of its future, when, without warning, the shadow of
      God's hand spread over it. The awful past was unrolled&mdash;one man and
      woman, for selfish, personal desires, were at the root of it all. Some
      shallow thinkers claim that there is no hell, neither spiritual nor
      material. To convince such individuals I would point the scornful finger
      of proof to the agony of that young man. Are they&mdash;that selfish
      couple&mdash;enjoying the bliss of the redeemed and he, the helpless
      product of their sin, suffering as you know he must be suffering? In this
      case the tangible and visible must establish the verity of the vague and
      invisible. They are paying the debt&mdash;somewhere, somehow&mdash;you may
      count on that.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter, with bated breath, eyed Cynthia askance. To
      her astonishment a flush had risen into the girl's cheeks, and there was
      in her steady eye something like the thin-spread tear of deep and
      glorified emotion, as she sat with tightly clasped hands, her breast
      tumultuously heaving. The house was very still, so still that the rustling
      of the leaves in the trees near the open windows now and then swept like
      the soft sighing of grief-stricken nature through the room. Hillhouse, a
      baffled, almost hunted look on his gaunt face, paused to take a sup of
      water, and for one instant his eyes met Cynthia's as he wiped his mouth on
      his handkerchief and with trembling hands returned it to his pocket. Mrs.
      Porter was conscious of the impression that he had not quite carried the
      subject to its logical climax, and was wondering how it had happened, when
      Hillhouse almost abruptly closed his discourse. He sat down, as if crushed
      by the weight of defeat, and looked steadily and despondently at the
      floor, while the congregation stood and sang the doxology. Then he rose
      and, with hands out-stretched as stiffly as those of a wired skeleton, he
      pronounced the benediction.
    </p>
    <p>
      As they were turning to leave, Cynthia and her mother faced old Nathan,
      who stood waiting for them.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hillhouse don't look one bit well to-day,&rdquo; he observed, as they were
      going out. &ldquo;I'll bet he's been eatin' some o' the fool stuff women an'
      gals has been concoctin' to bewitch 'im with. They say the shortest road
      to a man's heart is through his stomach&mdash;it's the quickest route to a
      man's grave, too, I'm here to state to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, do hush!&rdquo; Mrs. Porter exclaimed, her mind on something foreign to
      Nathan's comment. &ldquo;You two walk on; I'm going to shake hands with Brother
      Hillhouse and ask about his mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She fell back behind the crowd surging through the door, and waited for
      the preacher to come down the aisle to her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I couldn't see exactly what you were driving at,&rdquo; she said, extending her
      hand. &ldquo;I never heard finer argument or argument put in better language
      than what you said, but it seemed to me you left off something.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>did</i>,&rdquo; he said, desperately. &ldquo;I was going to end up with the evil
      tendencies he had inherited from his parents, and the pitfalls such a man
      would lead others into, but I couldn't drive my tongue to it. I had gone
      too far in dilating on his wrongs for that, and then I caught sight of
      Cynthia's face. I read it. I read through it down into the depths of her
      soul. What I was saying was only making her glory in the prospect of
      self-sacrifice in his behalf. When I saw that&mdash;when I realized that
      it will take a miracle of God to snatch her from him, I felt everything
      swimming about me. Her flushed face, her sparkling, piercing eyes, drove
      me wild. I started in to attack him behind his back and was foiled in the
      effort. But I won't give up. I can't lose her&mdash;I <i>can't</i>, I tell
      you! She was made for me. I was made for her, and she would realize it if
      this devil's dream would pass.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter sighed. &ldquo;I don't know what to do,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;If I could
      trust him, I'd give in, but I can't. I can't let my only child go off with
      any man of his stamp, on those conditions. But I must run on&mdash;they
      are waiting for me. She must never suspect that this was done for her
      benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was the afternoon of the day set for the meeting between Cynthia and
      Floyd. Mrs. Porter, still carrying her weighty secret, went into town
      actuated by nothing but the hope that she might accidentally meet
      Hillhouse. He seemed to be on the lookout for her, for he came down the
      street from the village square and waited for her to join him near the
      hitching-rack and public trough for the watering of horses.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was on the way to see you,&rdquo; she said, looking about her cautiously, as
      if averse to being seen in his company.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In answer to my prayer,&rdquo; he replied. &ldquo;I'm suffering great agony, Sister
      Porter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you are not any worse off than I am,&rdquo; she made answer. &ldquo;She's my
      only child.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He leaned towards her till his face was close to her own. &ldquo;Something must
      be done,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;I'm ready for anything. I can't bear it any longer.
      Last night the devil rose in me and conquered me. I was ready to kill
      him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And after all those beautiful things&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter smiled calmly&mdash;&ldquo;that
      you said about him in your sermon.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The feeling didn't last long,&rdquo; Hillhouse said, gloomily. &ldquo;It swept
      through me like a storm and left me on my knees praying God to spare her.
      Did she make any comment on my sermon?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, but I saw it failed to affect her as we wanted it to. I have kept a
      close watch on her. At times she's had the appearance of a woman giving up
      all hope, and then again a rebellious look would come in her face, and
      she'd move about with a quick step, her head up and a defiant expression,
      as if she was telling herself that she had a right to her happiness, and
      would have it at any cost.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, I guess she loves him,&rdquo; Hillhouse sighed; &ldquo;and she is fascinated by
      his hellish proposal and the thought that she is sacrificing something for
      his sake. I wish I could abuse him, but I can't. I can't blame him for
      trying to get her; it is no more than any man would do, any man who knows
      what she is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to ask you one thing, Brother Hillhouse&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter was
      looking at a row of cottages across the square&mdash;&ldquo;and I ask it as a
      member of your church and a woman that don't want to commit unpardonable
      sin. So far, I've tried to obey the commandments to the letter. I want to
      know if I'd ever be forgiven if I was to descend to downright deception&mdash;lying
      with my tongue and lying in my actions&mdash;that is, I mean, if, by so
      doing, I could save my child from this thing?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hillhouse avoided her piercing eyes; his own shifted under lowering brows.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If you could actually save her?&rdquo; he said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, if I could make her give him up&mdash;send him off?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll answer you this way,&rdquo; Hillhouse replied.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If she were in a room and a madman came searching for her with a pistol
      and a long knife bent upon killing her, and if he were to ask you, as you
      stood at the door, if she were inside, would you say yes?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I wouldn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there's your answer,&rdquo; said the preacher. &ldquo;He's a madman&mdash;mad
      in soul, brain, and body. He is seeking her eternal damnation, and the
      damnation of unborn souls. Lie?&rdquo; He laughed sardonically. &ldquo;Sister Porter,
      I could stand before God and lie that way, and wink at the angels hovering
      over the throne.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I reckon you are right,&rdquo; said the woman; &ldquo;but I wanted to make sure. And
      let me tell you something. If I <i>do</i> resort to lying I'll put up a
      good one, and I'll back it up by acting that she nor no one else could see
      through. Let me alone. Leave it to me. It's my last card, but I feel like
      it's going to win. I'm going home now. I can hardly walk, I feel so weak
      at the knees. I haven't slept regular since this thing came up. I'm going
      crazy&mdash;I know I am.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you mind telling me what you intend to do?&rdquo; Hillhouse asked, almost
      hopefully.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not ready to do that yet, but it will have a powerful effect on
      her. The only thing that bothered me was the sin of it, but since you
      think I'd have the right I'll throw my whole soul into it. She's so
      pure-minded that she won't suspect me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God grant that you succeed,&rdquo; Hillhouse said, fervently, and he stood as
      if rooted to the spot, and watched her till she had disappeared down the
      road leading to her home.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">D</span>URING supper that
      evening Mrs. Porter eyed her daughter furtively. Cynthia ate very little
      and seemed abstracted, paying no heed to her father's rambling,
      inconsequential remarks to her grandmother, who, in her white lace cap,
      sat across the table from him. Supper over, the family went out, leaving
      Cynthia to put the dishes away. Mrs. Radcliffe shambled quietly to her own
      room, and Porter took his pipe to his favorite chair on the porch. Being
      thus at liberty to carry out her own plans, Mrs. Porter stole unnoticed
      into Cynthia's room, and in the half-darkness looked about her. The room
      was in thorough order. The white bedspread was as smooth as a drift of
      snow, and the pillows had not a wrinkle or a crease. The old woman
      noiselessly opened the top drawer of the bureau; here everything was in
      its place. She looked in the next and the next with the same result. Then
      she stood erect in the centre of the room, an expression of perplexity on
      her face. Suddenly she seemed to have an inspiration, and she went to the
      girl's closet and opened the door. And there, under a soiled dress
      belonging to Cynthia, she found a travelling-bag closely packed.
    </p>
    <p>
      With a soundless groan, Mrs. Porter dropped the dress, closed the
      closet-door, and moved back to the centre of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can't stand it! She's fully made up her
      mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter left the room, and, passing her husband, whose placid face
      appeared intermittently in a red disk of light on the end of the porch,
      she went down the steps into the yard and thence around the house towards
      the orchard and grape-arbor. She paused among the trees, looking
      thoughtfully at the ground.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I'm going to do it,&rdquo; she reflected, &ldquo;I'd better throw out some hint in
      advance, to sort of lead up to it. I wonder if my mind is actually giving
      way? I am sure I've been through enough to&mdash;but somebody is coming.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      It was Cynthia, and she came daintily over the dewy grass.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, is that you?&rdquo; she called out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter made no reply.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, is that&mdash;but why didn't you answer me?&rdquo; Cynthia came up, a
      searching look of inquiry in her eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Still Mrs. Porter showed not the slightest indication of being aware of
      her presence. Cynthia, in increasing surprise, laid her hand on her
      mother's arm, but Mrs. Porter shook it off impatiently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Nathan, if you don't quit following me up, dogging my steps,
      and bothering me with your&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Porter broke off, looking blankly
      into Cynthia's face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, mother, what is the matter?&rdquo; the girl exclaimed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, you look like&mdash;you look like&mdash;&rdquo; Mrs. Porter moved to a
      near-by apple-tree and leaned against its trunk, and with her head down
      she began to laugh softly, almost sillily. Cynthia drew near her again,
      and, catching the old woman by the shoulders, she turned her forcibly to
      her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, what's the matter?&rdquo; she demanded, her tone now quite full of
      alarm. .
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Cynthia, nothing is the matter with me! I'm all right, but, but, but&mdash;good
      gracious! just this minute you were&mdash;we were all at the table. Your
      pa was in his place, mother was in hers, and, how in the world&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs.
      Porter was looking around in seeming astonishment&mdash;&ldquo;how in the world
      did I get out here? I don't remember leaving the house. The last thing I
      recall was&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, what's the matter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter stared in a bewildered way at her daughter for a moment, then
      she put her hand to her brow with a weary gesture. &ldquo;Something <i>must</i>
      be wrong with me,&rdquo; she declared. &ldquo;I didn't want to mention it, but this
      evening as I was coming back from town I got rather warm, and all at once
      I heard a little sound and felt something give way in my head. Oh,
      Cynthia, I'm afraid&mdash;I'm afraid I'm going like your aunt Martha did.
      They say hers was a drop of blood on the brain. Do you suppose it could be
      that, daughter?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, come on in the house and lie down. Go to bed, and you will
      feel better in the morning.&rdquo; Cynthia caught her arm, and, greatly
      perturbed, slowly led the old woman towards the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's worry, daughter,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, confidingly&mdash;&ldquo;worry about
      you. You seem to be bothered on account of Nelson Floyd's being away, and
      I've allowed that to prey on my thoughts.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Never mind him, mother,&rdquo; Cynthia said. &ldquo;Come on in and lie down. You
      don't feel any pain, do you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, daughter, not a bit&mdash;not a bit; but your aunt didn't, either.
      She didn't suffer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Don't you think we ought to send for the doctor, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Doctor? No&mdash;how ridiculous! Even if it is a drop on the brain, he
      couldn't do me a bit of good. The brain is inside the&mdash;the&mdash;what
      do you call it? See there, my mind isn't what it was. I can't think of as
      common a thing as a&mdash;you know what I mean, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean skull, mother,&rdquo; the girl said, anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I mean that. Your aunt's memory was bad, too. She suddenly forgot
      her own name, and came in from the strawberry-patch one day scared out of
      her senses. The next thing was her hand getting numb. My thumb feels
      queer; I believe you could stick a needle through it and I wouldn't feel
      it. But don't you tell your pa, Cynthia. Wait, anyway, till to-morrow, and
      see how I feel then. It may pass away, and then&mdash;then, again, it may
      be the first stroke. They say people about my age usually have three, and
      the last one ends it. I hope I'll go naturally&mdash;the way Martha went
      was horrible; and yet when I think of all my trouble I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Hush, mother, don't!&rdquo; Cynthia cried. They had now reached the porch.
      Porter had retired, and so they passed on unnoticed to Mrs. Porter's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia helped her mother undress and get into the bed, and then she went
      to her own room and sat down, irresolutely, at her table. She leaned her
      head on her crossed arms and remained quite still. She was very tired in
      brain and body, and presently dropped to sleep. She slept for about two
      hours. Suddenly she waked with a start. The clock in the sitting-room was
      striking ten. Nelson would be at the grape-arbor soon, she told herself
      with a shudder. Perhaps he was already there, and too cautious to whistle
      as on former meetings. She stood up, tiptoed to the closet, and opened the
      door. She uncovered the hidden valise and lifted it out into the light.
      Then a recollection of her mother's strange condition struck her like a
      blow in the face, and, standing in the centre of the room, she sighed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Just then she heard the tread of bare feet in the hall, and a low-mumbled
      monologue. Her heart stood still, for she recognized her mother's voice.
      Going softly to the door, she peered out, and there, in a thin, white
      dress, stood Mrs. Porter, Nathan's double-barrelled shot-gun clutched in
      her hand, her long hair hanging loose on her back. The old woman's face
      was averted, and she seemed unaware of her daughter's presence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Lord, my God, pardon me for this last act,&rdquo; she was praying. &ldquo;It may be a
      sin in Thy sight for a tortured person to seek escape from trouble by this
      course, but I can't stand it any longer.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, what is this?&rdquo; Cynthia darted out into the hall and snatched the
      gun from her mother's hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      For an instant Mrs. Porter stood staring at her daughter, and then, as if
      to escape her glance, she turned and went slowly into Cynthia's room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sh!&rdquo; she said; &ldquo;don't wake your pa.&rdquo; And, seeing Cynthia's lamp burning
      low, she blew down the chimney and put it out. The room was now dark save
      for the moonlight that struggled in at the windows on each side of the
      drawn shades.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother, you've got to tell me,&rdquo; Cynthia demanded, as she leaned the
      cumbersome weapon against the wall and groped towards the still, white
      figure; &ldquo;what were you going to do with that gun?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Porter said nothing, but moved backward to Cynthia's bed and, with a
      groan, sat down on it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;&mdash;Cynthia leaned over her, a horrible fear gripping her
      heart-cords&mdash;&ldquo;what were you about to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as I am obliged to tell you or anybody,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said,
      doggedly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother&rdquo;&mdash;Cynthia sat down by the old woman and put her arm about the
      gaunt figure&mdash;&ldquo;what were you going to do?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I was going to get out of my trouble, if you <i>will</i> know,&rdquo; Mrs.
      Porter said, looking her daughter defiantly in the face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Your trouble, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've borne it as long as I can. Huh! you can't guess how much I
      know. I was awake last Friday night and overheard your plan to run off
      with Nelson Floyd. I was in a yard of you, crouched down behind the
      rose-bushes. You said you'd decide by to-night, and ever since then I've
      been tortured like a condemned soul. That's what affected my brain to-day.
      It wasn't the sun. Since that awful hour I have been praying God to spare
      you&mdash;to have mercy on my misguided child, and I hoped He would do it,
      but to-night, while you were putting the dishes away, I came in here and
      saw your packed valise, and knew you had concluded to leave. Then&mdash;then
      I decided to&mdash;to go like Sister Martha did. I was going out in the
      meadow, by the creek, where it was quiet. I couldn't bear the thought of
      having to face all those curious people who will throng the house
      to-morrow to find out about your disgrace.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you were there?&rdquo; Cynthia gasped&mdash;&ldquo;you heard?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Every word,&rdquo; answered Mrs. Porter; &ldquo;and every one was a rusty nail in my
      heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. Cynthia had no defence to offer. She simply sat with
      bowed head, her arm lying limp upon her mother's thinly clad shoulders.'
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, you made up your mind to stain forever our family record. No other
      girl that I ever heard of, even among our far-off kin, ever threw away her
      honor as you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Stop, mother, you are going too far!&rdquo; Cynthia cried, removing her arm and
      standing erect before the old woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, my <i>poor, poor baby!</i> in all that man said the other night
      he didn't once mention marriage.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But he meant it, mother!&rdquo; broke from the girl's pallid lips&mdash;&ldquo;he
      meant it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He didn't mean anything of the kind, you little fool! As plain as plain
      could be, he said, right out, that he had no name to give you. And any
      fool knows no marriage can be legal unless it is brought about under the
      lawful names of the contracting parties. He simply was trying to give you
      to understand that he wanted you as a companion in his sin and misery. He
      has lost his right to a foothold in society, and he wants you, of your own
      accord and free will, to renounce yours. It was a crazy idea, and one that
      could have come from none but a brain disordered by liquor, but that is
      what he had in view.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe it,&rdquo; Cynthia said, firmly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It doesn't make any difference what you believe,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter returned.
      &ldquo;I'm older than you, and I see through him. He tried and tried to ruin you
      as he did Minnie Wade, but when he was reduced to despair by his trouble
      he rose from his debauch and wanted to turn his very misfortune to your
      undoing. The idiot was trying to make himself believe, because his parents
      had brought all that nastiness down on him, that he would be justified in
      a like course. The disgrace he had inherited he intended to hand down to
      another generation, and you&mdash;you poor, simple thing!&mdash;you calmly
      packed your white, unspotted things and were ready to sell yourself to his
      hellish purpose.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was awful silence. Cynthia stared, unable to utter a word. She may
      have doubted the fairness of her mother's version, but the grim picture
      painted there in the darkness by a woman in seeming readiness to take her
      own life on account of it fairly chilled her young life's blood. Suddenly
      a sound broke the outside stillness. There was no mistaking it. It rang
      out as shrilly on the girl's quaking consciousness as the shriek of a
      locomotive dashing through a mountain gorge.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There he is now,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter. &ldquo;Pick up your valise and hurry, hurry
      to him; but before you go hand me that gun. Before you and he get in that
      buggy you'll hear my death-knell, and you may know, too, that you fired
      the shot into the withered breast that nursed you. Go! I'm not keeping
      you!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia swayed visibly in the darkness, and then she sank to her knees and
      put her head in her mother's lap.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I won't go,&rdquo; she groaned, softly. &ldquo;Mother, I'll do anything you say&mdash;anything!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Now you are joking, I know,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, harshly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I mean it&mdash;God knows I mean it, mother! Only give me a chance to
      prove that I mean it. I'll never see him again, if that will suit you&mdash;never
      on earth! I'll stay and nurse you and make you well.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;If I thought you meant that, Cynthia&mdash;Lord, Lord, what a load it
      would take off of me! Don't&mdash;don't say that unless you mean it; the&mdash;the
      joy of saving you would almost kill me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, God knows I mean it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter seemed to squeeze her words from her frail body
      as she stiffly rose to her feet&mdash;&ldquo;then you must let me go, myself,
      out there and send him off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia, still on her knees, glanced up, her startled eyes wide open.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Would you ask that, mother?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, for in my present condition I'm afraid I'd never believe it was
      absolutely settled. I&mdash;I'm not as clear-headed as I used to be. I've
      got deep-rooted suspicions, and I'm afraid they would prey on my mind.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go, mother&mdash;go send him away. I'd rather never see him again on
      earth than to cause you to&mdash;to contemplate&mdash;but go, mother!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you stay here then.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter was moving towards the door. &ldquo;I'll
      be easy with him. I'm so happy over this release that I feel grateful even
      to him. I'll be gentle, Cynthia.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she stood in the door-way of the chamber and glanced back, Mrs. Porter
      saw Cynthia throw herself face downward on the bed. The old woman was in
      the hall making her way towards the front-door when she heard Cynthia call
      her. Retracing her steps, she found her daughter sitting up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mother,&rdquo; the girl said, &ldquo;let me go with you. You can hear all that passes
      between us. That ought to be satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, that won't suit me,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, firmly. &ldquo;I've set my heart on
      your never facing that man again. For you to go, it would look like you
      are crazy after him, and he'd hang around here no telling how long.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then go on, mother.&rdquo; Cynthia fell back on the bed, and, covering her face
      with her hands, lay still.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">A</span>S Mrs. Porter
      stepped down into the yard the whippoorwill call sounded again. &ldquo;Huh!&rdquo; she
      said to herself, exultingly, &ldquo;I reckon I'll reach there soon enough to
      suit you, Nelson Floyd. You wanted to get her away from her mother's
      tongue, did you? Well, you'll find that I'm no fool, if I <i>am</i> old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she emerged from the shade of the apple-trees into the little open in
      front of the grape-arbor, Nelson Floyd, the red, impatient flare of a
      cigar in his face, appeared in the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God you didn't fail me!&rdquo; he exclaimed, in accents of vast relief.
      &ldquo;For a while I was actually afraid&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Afraid that I wouldn't be on time!&rdquo; Mrs. Porter broke in, with a metallic
      little laugh. &ldquo;I always keep my engagements, Nelson Floyd&mdash;or, I beg
      your pardon, Cynthia says you don't call yourself by that name now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God, it's <i>you!</i>&rdquo; he exclaimed, and his cigar fell at his
      feet. &ldquo;Why, Mrs. Porter&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, we needn't stand here and take up time talking about whether it's
      going to rain or not,&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;The truth is, I'm due in bed. I've
      been asleep in my chair half a dozen times since supper. You see, I
      promised Cynthia that I'd keep this appointment for her, and she tumbled
      into bed, and is snoozing along at a great rate, while I am doing her
      work.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you promised&mdash;I&mdash;I&mdash;don't understand,&rdquo; Floyd
      managed to get out of the chaos of his brain.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I reckon you don't see it exactly <i>our</i> way,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter
      sneered. &ldquo;And that's because of your high opinion of your own charm. There
      is nothing on earth that will lead a man from the road of fact as quick as
      vanity. You thought my girl would jump at your proposition, but, la me!
      she just dallied with you to get you away last Friday night. At least,
      that's what I think, for she brought the whole thing to me the next
      morning, even telling me how you abused me behind my back. She asked me
      how she'd better get out of it. Most girls plunge headlong into things of
      this kind without deliberation, but she's not that way. She generally
      looks ahead, and the truth is, if I may tell state secrets, she has a
      strong leaning towards Brother Hillhouse. He's a good man&mdash;a man that
      can be counted on&mdash;and a man with a respectable family behind him,
      and, while I'm not sure about it, I think she intends to accept him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God, Mrs. Porter, you don't mean that she&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You see there! I knew you were incapable of seeing anything that don't
      tend to your own glory. You thought all along that my girl was crazy about
      you, but you didn't know her. She's no fool. She's got a long head on her
      shoulders.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But didn't she&mdash;she send me any message?&rdquo; Floyd asked, in a tone of
      abject bewilderment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, now I come to think of it, she did. She said for me to beg you
      never to bother her any more.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She said that? Oh, Mrs. Porter, I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and just as she was cuddling up in bed&rdquo;&mdash;Mrs. Porter's
      selection of words had never been so adroit&mdash;&ldquo;she called me to her
      and said that she wondered if you would mind never telling how foolish she
      had been to meet you out here like she did. I don't know why she was so
      particular, unless it is that people in this day and time love to throw up
      to a preacher's wife all the imprudent things she did when she was young.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Porter, do you actually think Cynthia loves that man?&rdquo; Floyd's voice
      shook, and he leaned heavily against the frame of the arbor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Love him? How can anybody tell who a woman loves? They don't know
      themselves half the time; but I'll say this to you: Mr. Hillhouse has been
      courting her in an open, straightforward way, and that pleased her. He's a
      man of brains, too, and is going to work his way high up in his
      profession. He'll be a great light some day. The regard of a man like that
      is a compliment to a poor country girl; and then she is sure of a life of
      solid respectability, while with you&mdash;good gracious! What's the use
      of talking about it? But you haven't told me whether you will agree not to
      bother her again. She'll be anxious to know what you said about that. You
      see, you might get drunk again, and there is no telling how foolish and
      persistent you may become, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I shall not bother her again,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;Tell her I gave you my
      faithful promise on that. Not only that, but I am going away, and shall
      never come back here again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'll tell her&mdash;I'll tell her in the morning as soon as she
      wakes up. La me! I used to be a girl myself, and there was no bother equal
      to having an old beau hanging around, as we girls used to say in slang,
      after he'd got his 'walking papers'&mdash;that is, after the right man was
      settled on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There is one thing I want you to tell her&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd breathed heavily&mdash;&ldquo;and
      that is that I'll never care for any other girl.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Shucks! I won't take any such message as that,&rdquo; the old woman sniffed.
      &ldquo;Besides, what's the use? After a flirtation is laid away it ought to die
      a natural death. The biggest wasters of time in the world are married
      women who love to look back on old love-scrapes, and sit and brag about
      them, instead of mending socks and attending to the responsibilities that
      are piled up on every hand. Well, I'm going in now. It's been a long, hot
      day, but in this thin dress I feel chilly. I don't want to be hard on you,
      and I wish you well, so I do, where-ever you go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank you, Mrs. Porter,&rdquo; and, with his head hanging low, Nelson Floyd
      turned to leave. &ldquo;I can only assure you,&rdquo; he added, &ldquo;that I'll never
      trouble Cynthia any more. I shall certainly respect her wish.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right; that's as much as she could ask of you,&rdquo; the old woman
      returned; &ldquo;and perhaps, since you are so polite, I ought to thank you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      As she was drawing near the house, she said to herself with a low,
      satisfied chuckle: &ldquo;I believe I worked him exactly right. If I'd 'a' let
      him know I suspected his full villany he wouldn't have been shaken off so
      easily. But what am I going to do about that drop of blood on my brain?&rdquo;
       she laughed. &ldquo;If I get rid of it too suddenly Cynthia may smell a mouse. I
      believe I'll wait a few days and then tell her I think my stroke was due
      to that new hair-restorer I'm using, an' promise to throw it away.&rdquo; She
      paused at the steps and shuddered. &ldquo;But am I not really a little off?&rdquo; she
      mused. &ldquo;Surely no woman in the full possession of her senses could have
      gone through all that, as if it were God's truth from beginning to end.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Inside the hall, after she had softly shut the front door, she saw Cynthia
      standing on the threshold of her chamber.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did you see him, mother?&rdquo; The question was hardly above a whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh yes, I saw him,&rdquo; the old woman answered, frigidly. &ldquo;I saw him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What did he say, mother?&rdquo; The girl's voice was low, tremulous, and
      halting.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know as he said much of anything, he was so set back by
      seeing me in this outfit instead of you in your best Sunday-go-to-meeting,
      with your valise in hand, ready to fly to the moon with him. He let me do
      most of the talking.&rdquo; Mrs. Porter managed to stifle a chuckle of
      satisfaction, and the darkness hid her impulsive smile. &ldquo;He seemed to be
      more reasonable, though, than most men would be in his condition. I don't
      think he was fully sober; he smoked like a steam-engine, dropping cigars
      and lighting fresh ones, as if they were his main-stay and support. He
      agreed with me, in a roundabout way, that it was a foolish thing for him
      to expect a respectable girl to run off in the dead of night with a man of
      his stamp, and he ended by saying for me to tell you that he was going
      away off somewhere and that he wouldn't bother you any more. He looked and
      acted like a thief caught on the spot with the goods in hand and was ready
      to promise anything to escape arrest and prosecution.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you have had your way, mother,&rdquo; Cynthia said, quietly; &ldquo;I hope you
      will feel better satisfied now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I will, I will&mdash;in fact, I feel some better already.&rdquo; There was
      another incipient chuckle far down in Mrs. Porter's throat, but she
      coughed it away. &ldquo;I really feel like I'm going to get well. I'll sleep
      like a log to-night. You'd better turn in yourself, daughter.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, mother&mdash;good-night.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning, shortly after breakfast, as Mrs. Porter was attending to
      some hens' nests in the barn-yard, Hillhouse crept out of the thicket just
      beyond the fence and approached her. He was quite pale and nervous, and
      bent his head and shoulders that the high staked-and-ridered rail-fence
      might hide him from the view of the house.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've been out here in the woods for an hour watching your back-door,&rdquo; he
      said. &ldquo;I was in hopes that I'd see Cynthia moving about in the diningroom
      or kitchen. You see, I don't know yet whether she went off last night or
      stayed. I haven't closed my eyes since I saw you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you <i>have</i> got it bad,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter laughed, dryly, &ldquo;and you
      needn't worry any more. I reckon I spilled ink all over my record in the
      Lamb's Book of Life, but I set in to succeed, and I worked it so fine that
      she let me go out and send him away for good and all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Sister Porter, is that true?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's a great deal truer than anything that passed my lips last night,&rdquo;
       Mrs. Porter answered, crisply. &ldquo;Brother Phillhouse, if I ever get
      forgiveness, there is one of the commandments that will have to be cut out
      of the list, for I certainly broke it all to smash. I had a separate lie
      stowed away in every pore of my skin last night, and they hung like
      cockle-burs to every hair of my head. I wish I was a Catholic.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A Catholic?&rdquo; Hillhouse repeated, his eyes dancing in delight, his sallow
      skin taking on color.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'd sell our horses and cows and land, and give it to a priest, and
      tell him to wipe my soul clean with the proceeds. I feel happy, and I feel
      mean. Something tells me that I'd have made an expert woman thief&mdash;perhaps
      the greatest in the history of all nations.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What sort of fibs did you tell, Sister Porter?&rdquo; Hillhouse was smiling
      unctuously and rubbing his long hands together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I don't intend to tell you,&rdquo; said the old woman; &ldquo;besides, it would
      take a week. I spun the finest fabric of falsehood that was ever made. And
      I'm not done yet, for I've got to keep it up, and not let it lop off too
      suddenly.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, do you think there will be any living chance for me?&rdquo; the preacher
      said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do&mdash;that is, if you won't push matters too fast and will be
      patient. I have a plan now that you will like. Didn't you tell me you were
      going to preach two sermons this month at Cartersville?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I take Brother Johnston's place for two weeks while he goes off for
      his vacation.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, &ldquo;you know Nathan's brother George lives there.
      In fact, his wife and daughters belong to Mr. Johnston's church. George is
      a well-to-do lawyer, and his children dote on Cynthia; now I'm going to
      send her down there for a change.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, that will be simply fine!&rdquo; Hillhouse cried, his face aglow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and if you can't make hay while the sun shines down there, you'll
      deserve to fail. Cynthia has promised to give Floyd up, and he's agreed
      not to bother her any more. Now you slip back into the woods. I wouldn't
      have her see you here at this time of day for anything. When she gets her
      thinking apparatus to work she's going to do a lot of wondering, anyway.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>EN days passed. It
      was now towards the close of a hot and sultry August. Nothing more had
      been heard of Nelson Floyd, and the sensation due to his mysterious
      absence had, to some extent, subsided. That Mayhew knew of his whereabouts
      few persons doubted, for it was noticeable that the old man had put his
      shoulder to the wheel and was attending to business with less fear and
      nervousness. It was the opinion of Mrs. Snodgrass that he knew exactly
      where Floyd was, and expected him to return sooner or later. In fact, it
      was known to many that Mayhew had suddenly ceased to make inquiry through
      detectives and the police, and that meant something. The information that
      Floyd had been back in secret to his home would have startled the
      community from centre to outer edge, but that was discreetly kept to
      themselves by the few who knew of it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole Baker was the first to meet Floyd again. It was in Atlanta. Standing
      in the main entrance of the Kimball House one afternoon, Pole saw Floyd on
      the opposite side of the street. He was walking rapidly, his head up. He
      was neatly dressed, cleanshaven, and had a clear, healthful complexion, as
      if he were in good physical condition.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God! thar he goes,&rdquo; Pole exclaimed, &ldquo;an' I'll bet a hoss he's quit
      drinkin'.&rdquo; Quickly darting across the street, he followed Floyd the best
      he could on the crowded sidewalk. He had pursued him thus for several
      blocks when Floyd suddenly entered one of the large wholesale dry-goods
      stores. Reaching the door and looking in, Pole saw his friend just
      disappearing in the glass-enclosed office in the rear of the big room.
      Pole entered and stood waiting amid the stacks of cotton and woollen goods
      which, in rolls and bolts, were heaped as high as his shoulders over the
      whole floor. Salesmen were busy with customers in different parts of the
      room, and porters and &ldquo;stock men&rdquo; hurried by with big baskets on wheels,
      and little notice was taken of the mountaineer.
    </p>
    <p>
      Presently Floyd emerged and came rapidly down one of the aisles towards
      the door. Pole stepped directly in front of him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, hello!&rdquo; Floyd exclaimed, flushing suddenly as he cordially extended
      his hand. &ldquo;I wasn't looking for you, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you differ from me,&rdquo; said Baker; &ldquo;that's just what I was doin'. I
      was lookin' fer you, Nelson. I begun yesterday an' kept it up till I seed
      you go by the Kimball jest now like you was shot out of a gun, an' I bent
      to the trail, an' here I am. Yes, I want to see you. I've got a favor to
      ax, old friend.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you can have anything I've got.&rdquo; Floyd smiled rather sheepishly as
      he laid his hand on Pole's shoulder. &ldquo;The only trouble right now is that
      I'm pressed for time. A lot depends on what may take place in the next two
      hours, and I'm afraid to think of anything else. When do you go back?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I kin take a train any time. I'm in no big hurry, Nelson. All I want
      is to get to talk to you a few minutes.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I'll tell you what to do,&rdquo; Floyd proposed. &ldquo;Take this key to my room
      at the Kimball House. I've got a bed to spare up there. And, more than
      that, Pole, go in and take your supper in my place. It will be all right.
      I registered on the American plan. Then I'll meet you in the room about
      eight o'clock. You see, it's this way: I've brought a fellow with me from
      Birmingham, and he's back there in the office now. He and I are on a trade
      for all my iron lands in Alabama. A thing like this is a big, exciting
      game with me; it drives out all other thoughts, and, the Lord knows, right
      now I need some diversion. He and I are going to the house of a friend of
      his in the country and take early supper there. I'll be back by eight,
      sure, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That'll suit me all right,&rdquo; said Pole, as he took the key and looked at
      the number on the brass tag. &ldquo;I'll be there, Nelson. I wouldn't let you
      stand for my expenses, but if your bill's paid anyway, that's different.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it won't cost me a cent extra,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;Here comes my man now.
      I'd introduce you, but we are in a devil of a hurry.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you ready?&rdquo; a middle-aged man in a linen suit and straw hat asked, as
      he walked up hastily. &ldquo;I'll make the driver strike a brisk gait.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I'm ready,&rdquo; Floyd said, and he turned to Baker. &ldquo;Don't forget,
      Pole.&rdquo; As he was walking away, he threw back: &ldquo;I'll meet you at eight or
      before, sure. I don't want to miss you.&rdquo;

    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HAT night, after
      supper, Pole was in Floyd's room at the hotel. The weather being warm, he
      had raised the window, which opened on a busy street, and sat smoking,
      with his coat off. From the outside came the clanging of street-car bells
      and the shrill voices of newsboys crying the afternoon papers. Suddenly he
      heard the iron door of the elevator slide back, and a moment later Floyd
      stood on the threshold of the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I succeeded, Pole!&rdquo; he cried, sitting down on the window-sill and
      fanning himself with his straw hat. &ldquo;I sold out, lock, stock, and barrel,
      and at an advance that I never would have dreamed of asking if I hadn't
      been in a reckless mood. Really, I didn't know the property was so
      valuable. My man kept hanging onto me, following me from place to place,
      wanting to know what I'd take, till finally, simply to get rid of him, I
      priced the property at three times what I had ever asked for it. To mv
      astonishment, he said he would come over to Atlanta with me, and if
      certain friends of his would help him carry it he would trade. Pole, my
      boy, I've made more money to-day than I've made all the rest of my life
      put together, and&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd sighed as he tossed his hat on one of the
      beds and locked his hands behind his neck&mdash;&ldquo;I reckon I care less for
      material prosperity than I ever did.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm glad you made a good trade,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;You were born lucky,
      my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I don't know,&rdquo; answered Floyd; &ldquo;but here I am talking about my own
      affairs when you came to see me about yours. What can I do for you, Pole?
      If it's money you want, you certainly came to headquarters, and you can
      get all you want and no questions asked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't come to see you on my own business, Nelson,&rdquo; Pole answered. &ldquo;I'm
      here on account of old man Mayhew. Nelson, he's mighty nigh plumb crazy
      over you bein' away. He can't run that thing up thar single-handed; he's
      leaned too long on you fer that, an' then he's gittin' old and sorter
      childish. I never knowed it before, Nelson, but he looks on you sorter
      like a son. The old fellow's eyes got full an' he choked up when he was
      beggin' me to come down here an' see you. He gathered from yore last
      letter that you intended to go West and live, an' he called me in an'
      begged me to come and persuade you not to do it. Nelson, I'll hate it like
      rips, too, ef you leave us. Them old mountains is yore rightful home, an'
      I'm here to tell you that God Almighty never give any one man more friends
      than you've got amongst them plain, honest folks. By gum! they jest stand
      around in bunches an' talk an' talk about you an'&mdash;an' yore&mdash;late
      trouble. Thar ain't one in the lot but what 'ud be glad to help you bear
      it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd stood up suddenly, and, with his hands behind him, he began to walk
      back and forth across the room.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's the only spot on earth I'll ever care about,&rdquo; Pole heard him say in
      a deep, husky voice, &ldquo;and God knows I love the people; but I don't want to
      go back, Pole. Fate rather rubbed it in on me up there. All my early life
      I nursed the hope that I would eventually be able to prove that my parents
      were good, respectable people, and then when I was beginning to despair it
      went out that I belonged to a great and high family, and the aristocracy
      of the section extended their hands and congratulated me and patted me on
      the back. But that wasn't for long. My guardian angel&mdash;my old
      stand-by, Pole&mdash;came to me with a malignant grin and handed me the
      information that I was&mdash;was what you couldn't call the humblest man
      you know up there and live a minute later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know&mdash;I know, Nelson,&rdquo; sighed Pole, his honest face tortured by
      inward sympathy. &ldquo;I see you've got a big, big argument in favor o' the
      step you are thinking about, but I want to see if I can't put it to you in
      another light. Listen to me, my boy. Different men suffer in different
      ways. Maybe you don't think I've suffered any to speak of. But, my boy,
      when I was tried by my peers up thar, in the open court of God's soft
      starlight&mdash;-when my neighbors, well-meanin', fair-thinkin' folks,
      come to me in the night-time an' called me out to lay the lash on my bare
      back fer wilful neglect o' them that was dear an' true to me, all&mdash;all,
      I say&mdash;that was wuth a tinker's damn in me sunk down, down into the
      bottomless pit o' hell. I thought about shirkin', about pullin' up stakes
      an' goin' away off some'rs to begin new, but I seed that wouldn't wipe it
      out o' folks' memories, nor out o' me, and so I decided to stay right thar
      an' fight&mdash;fight it to a finish. It was awful to meet them men in the
      light o' day with the'r masks off, an' know what each one was a-think-in',
      but I went through it, and, thank God, I begin to see light ahead. It
      looks like they understand my struggle an' think none the less o' me.
      Lord, Lord, ef you could jest witness the kind words an' gentle ways o'
      them men towards me an' mine now, you'd believe what preachers say about
      the spirit o' God dwellin' in every man's breast.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd had turned, and he now laid a sympathetic hand on Pole's shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knew what you were going through,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I wanted to help you,
      but didn't know how. Then this damned thing came on me like a bolt from a
      clear sky.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Nelson, listen to me. I am here to-night to beg you to do like I done&mdash;to
      come back to yore old home and meet that thing face to face. As God is my
      judge, I believe sech great big troubles as yore'n are laid on folks fer a
      good purpose. Other men have gone through exactly what you've had to bear,
      an' lived to become great characters in the history o' the world's
      progress. Nelson, that's the one an' only thing left fer you to do. It's
      hell, but it will be fer yore own good in the end. Buck up agin it, my
      boy, an' what seems hard now will look as easy after a while as failin'
      off a log.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd turned and began to walk back and forth again. The room was filled
      with silence. Through the open window came the sound of brass musical
      instruments, the rattling of a tambourine, the ringing of cymbals. Then a
      clear voice&mdash;that of a young woman&mdash;rose in a sacred song. It
      was a band of Salvationists clustered near a street corner under a hanging
      arc light. Floyd paused near to Pole and looked thoughtfully from the
      window; then he sat down on the bed. For a moment he stared at the floor,
      and then, folding his arms across his breast, he suddenly raised his head.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; he said, firmly, &ldquo;I'm going to take your advice.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was silence. The two men sat facing each other. Suddenly the
      mountaineer leaned over and said: &ldquo;Give me your hand on it, Nelson. You'll
      never regret this as long as you live.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd extended his hand and then got up and began to walk back and forth
      across the room again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I've got another trouble to bear, Pole,&rdquo; he said, gloomily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you have, Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and it is worse than all. Pole, I've lost the love of the only woman
      I ever really cared for.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean Cynthia Porter?&rdquo; said Pole, and he leaned forward, his eyes
      burning.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floyd nodded, took one or two steps, and then paused near to Pole. &ldquo;You
      don't know it, perhaps, but I've been back up there lately.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I went back to see her. I couldn't stay away from her. I had been on
      a protracted spree. I was on the brink of suicide, in a disordered
      condition of mind and body, when all at once it occurred to me that
      perhaps she might not absolutely scorn me. Pole, the very hope that she
      might be willing to share my misfortune suddenly sobered me. I was in an
      awful condition, but I stopped drinking and went up there one night. I
      secretly met her and proposed an elopement. The poor little girl was so
      excited that she would not decide then, but she agreed to give me her
      final decision a week later.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Great God! you don't mean it, Nelson!&rdquo; the mountaineer cried in surprise&mdash;&ldquo;shorely
      you don't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I do. Then I went back to fill the appointment, but she had confided
      it all to her mother, and the old lady came out and told me that Cynthia
      not only refused me, but that she earnestly hoped I would never bother her
      again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My Lord!&rdquo; Pole exclaimed; &ldquo;and there was a time when I actually thought&mdash;but
      that's <i>her</i> matter, Nelson. A man hain't got no right on earth
      dabblin' in a woman's heart-affairs. To me nothin' ain't more sacred than
      a woman's choice of her life-partner.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Mrs. Porter hinted plainly that Cynthia was thinking of marrying
      Hillhouse,&rdquo; said Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, now I begin to see ahead!&rdquo; the farmer said, reflectively. &ldquo;Cynthia's
      down at Cartersville now, on a visit to her cousins, and the long-legged
      parson is there, too, filling in for another preacher. I don't pretend to
      understand women, Nelson. Thar's been a lots o' talk about her and
      Hillhouse since you went off. I axed Sally what she thought about it, an'
      she seemed to think if Cynthia had quit thinkin' o' you it was due to the
      reports in circulation that you had started in to drinkin'. Sally thought
      that Cynthia was one woman that 'ud not resk her chance with a drinkin'
      man. Cynthia's a good girl, Nelson, and maybe she thinks she kin make
      herse'f useful in life by marrying a preacher. I dunno. And then he is a
      bright sort of fellow; he is sharp enough to know that she is the smartest
      and best unmarried woman in Georgia. Well, that will be purty hard fer you
      to bear, but you must face it along with the other, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I've got to grin and bear it,&rdquo; Floyd said, almost under his breath.
      &ldquo;I've got to face that and the knowledge that I might have won her if I
      had gone about it in the right way. From my unfortunate father I have
      inherited some gross passions, Pole, and I was not always strong enough to
      rise above them. I made many big mistakes before I met her, and even after
      that, I blush to say, my old tendency clung to me so that&mdash;well, I
      never understood her, as she really deserved, till the day you raked me
      over the coals at the bush-arbor meeting. Pole, that night, when she and I
      were thrown by the storm in that barn together, I remembered all you said.
      It seemed to give me new birth, and I saw her for the first time as she
      was, in all her wonderful womanly strength and beauty of character and
      soul, and from that moment I loved her. My God, Pole, the realization of
      that big, new passion broke over me like a great, dazzling light. It took
      me in its grasp and shook everything that was vile and gross out of me.
      From that moment I could never look into her face for very shame of having
      failed to comprehend her.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I seed you was in danger,&rdquo; Pole said, modestly. &ldquo;It was a mighty hard
      thing to have to talk as I did to a friend, but I felt that it was my
      duty, and out it come. I'm not goin' to take no hand in this, though,
      Nelson. I think you are in every way worthy o' her, but, as I say, only a
      woman kin tell who she ought to yoke with fer life. If she refused you,
      after due deliberation, an' decided on another man, why, I hain't one
      single word to say. I'm after her happiness, as I'm after yore'n. I'd like
      to see you linked together, but ef that ain't to be, then I want to see
      you both happy apart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment neither spoke. Then it seemed that Pole wanted to change the
      subject.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In tryin' to run upon you this mornin', Nelson,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;I went out to
      yore&mdash;out to Henry A. Floyd's. That woman, his housekeeper, met me at
      the door an' let me inside the hall. She's a kind, talkative old soul, and
      she's worried mighty nigh to death about the old man. She remembered
      seein' me before, an' she set in to tellin' me all about his troubles. It
      seems that he's had some lawsuit, an' his last scrap o' property is to be
      tuck away from him. She told me thar was a debt of three thousand dollars
      to pay in the morning or' everything would go. While she was talkin' he
      come along, lookin' more dead than alive, an' I axed 'im ef he could put
      me on to yore track. He glared at me like a crazy man; his jaws was all
      sunk in, an' with his gray hair an' beard untrimmed, an' his body all of a
      quiver, he simply looked terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;'No,' said he, 'I don't know whar you kin find 'im. I've heard that he
      was in trouble, an' I'm sorry, fer I know what trouble means,' an' with
      that he stood thar twistin' his hands an' cryin' like a pitiful little
      child about the three thousand dollars his creditors wanted, an' that thar
      wasn't a ghost of a chance to raise it. He said he'd made every effort,
      an' now was starin' starvation in the face. He turned an' went back to his
      room, puttin' his old, bony hand on the wall to keep from failin' as he
      moved along. I'm a pore man, Nelson, but, by all that's holy, ef I'd 'a'
      had the money the old chap wanted this mornin' I'd 'a' hauled it out an'
      'a' kissed it farewell. I'm that way, Nelson. A fool an' his money is soon
      parted. I'd 'a' been seven idiots in a row ef I'd 'a' had that much cash,
      fer I'd certainly 'a' yanked that squirmin' old. chap off'n his bed o'
      coals.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd bent towards the speaker. Their eyes met understandingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I've got money, Pole&mdash;money to spare&mdash;and that old wreck is
      my father's only brother. I've made a fortune in a single deal to-day.
      Look here, Pole, I'm going out there to-night&mdash;<i>to-night</i>, do
      you understand?&mdash;to-night, before he goes to bed, and give him a
      check that will more than cover his shortage.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Are you goin' to do that, Nelson?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I am. Do you want to come along to witness it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'll wait fer you here, but God bless you, my boy. You'll never,
      never be sorry fer it, if you live to be a hundred years old.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd sat down at a table, and, with a checkbook in hand, was adjusting
      his fountain-pen. Pole went to the window and looked out. Down in the
      glare below a woman in a blue hood and dress stood praying aloud, in a
      clear, appealing voice, while all about her were grouped the other
      Salvationists and a few earnest-eyed spectators.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's right, Miss Blue-frock,&rdquo; Pole said to himself; &ldquo;go ahead an' rake
      in yore converts from the highways an' byways, but I've got one in this
      room you needn't bother about. By gum! ef it was jest a little darker in
      here, I'll bet I could see a ring o' fire round his head.&rdquo;

      XXXVIII
    </h2>
    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>N the street
      below, Nelson took a car for his uncle's residence, and fifteen minutes
      later he was standing on the veranda ringing the bell. Through a window on
      his left he looked into a lighted room. He saw old Floyd's bent figure
      moving about within, and then the housekeeper admitted him into the dimly
      lighted hall. She regarded him with surprise as she recalled his face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You want to see Mr. Floyd?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'll see if he will let you come
      in. He's in a frightful condition, sir, over his troubles. Really, sir,
      he's so desperate I'm afraid he may do himself some harm.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Leaving Nelson standing in the hall, she went into the lighted room, and
      the young man heard her talking persuasively to her master. Presently she
      came back and motioned the visitor to enter. He did so, finding the old
      man standing over a table covered with letters, deeds, and other legal
      documents. He did not offer his hand, and the young man stood in some
      embarrassment before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well,&rdquo; old Floyd said, &ldquo;what do you want? Are you here to gloat over me?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I am not,&rdquo; returned the visitor. &ldquo;It is simply because I do not feel
      that way that I came. A friend of mine was here to-day, and he said you
      were in trouble.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Trouble?&mdash;huh!&rdquo; snarled old Floyd. &ldquo;I guess you are glad to know
      that.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I certainly am not,&rdquo; Nelson said, warmly. &ldquo;I heard of it only a few
      minutes ago at the Kimball House, where I am staying, and I took the first
      car to reach you. I wish I had heard of the matter earlier&mdash;that is,
      if you will allow me to help you out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You&mdash;you help me?&rdquo; Old Floyd extended his thin hand and drew a chair
      to him and sank into it. &ldquo;They've all talked that way&mdash;every
      money-lender and banker that I have applied to. They all say they want to
      help, but when they look at these&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd waved his hand despondently
      over the documents&mdash;&ldquo;when they look at these, and see the size of the
      mortgage, they make excuses and back out. I don't want to waste time with
      you. I know what sort of man you are. You have made what you've got by
      being as close as the bark on a tree, and I'm going to tell you at the
      outset that I haven't any security&mdash;not a dollar's worth.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I didn't want security,&rdquo; Nelson said, looking sympathetically down into
      the withered face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't want&mdash;&rdquo; The old man, his hands on his knees, made an
      effort to rise, but failed. &ldquo;My Lord, you say you don't want security;
      then&mdash;then what the devil <i>do</i> you want?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to <i>give</i> you the money, if you'll do me the honor to accept
      it,&rdquo; Nelson declared. &ldquo;My friend told me the amount was exactly three
      thousand. I have drawn this check for four.&rdquo; The young man was extending
      the pink slip of paper towards him. &ldquo;And if that is not enough to put you
      squarely on your feet, I am ready to increase it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; The old man took the check and, with blearing eyes and
      shaking hands, examined it in the lamplight. &ldquo;You mean that you will <i>give</i>&mdash;actually,
      <i>give</i> me four thousand dollars, when I haven't a scrap of security
      to put up?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's exactly what I mean.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Old Floyd took his eyes from the check and shrinkingly raised them to the
      young man's face. Then he dropped the paper on the table and groaned.
      There was silence for a moment. The housekeeper, passing by the open door,
      looked in wonderingly, and moved on. The old man saw her, and, rising
      suspiciously, he shambled to the door and closed it. Then he turned
      aimlessly and came slowly back, his hand pressed to his brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I can't make it out,&rdquo; Nelson heard him muttering. &ldquo;I'm afraid of it. It
      may be a trick, and yet what trick could anybody play on a man in the hole
      I'm in? <i>Four thousand?</i>&rdquo; He was looking first at the check and then
      at his caller. &ldquo;Four thousand would save me from actual ruin&mdash;it
      would make me comfortable for life. I can't believe you mean to give it to
      me&mdash;really <i>give</i> it. The world isn't built that way. It would
      be very unbecoming in me to doubt you, to impugn your motives, sir, but
      I'm all upset. The doctors say my mind is affected. One lawyer, a sharper,
      suggested that I could get out of this debt by claiming that I was not
      mentally responsible when I signed the papers, but that wouldn't work. I
      knew mighty well what I was doing. Now, on top of it all, here you come&mdash;<i>you</i>
      of all living men&mdash;and, in so many plain English words&mdash;offer to
      give me a thousand more than the debt. Sir, I don't want to be impolite,
      but I simply can't believe that you mean it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Greatly moved, the young man put his hands on the old man's shoulders and
      gently pressed him down into his chair; then he got another and sat close
      to him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Try to look at this thing calmly,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;In the first place, you
      don't understand me. You are not a relative of mine by law, but by blood
      you are the only one I ever saw. You are the brother of the man who gave
      me life&mdash;such as it is&mdash;and, for aught I know, you may even
      resemble him. I have been in great trouble over the revelations you made
      recently, but all that has burned itself to a cinder within me, and I have
      determined to go back up there in the mountains and face it. But that
      isn't all. Certain investments I have made in the past are turning out
      money in the most prodigal manner. The amount I am offering you is a mere
      trifle to what I have made in one single transfer of property to-day. I
      sincerely want you to take it. It would give me great joy to help you,
      and, if you refuse, it will pain me more than I can say. We are not
      relatives before the world, but we are by ties of nature, and I pity you
      to-night as I never pitied any human being in my life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;My God! my God!&rdquo; The old man struggled again to his feet, his eyes
      avoiding Nelson's earnest stare. &ldquo;Wait here. Keep your seat, sir. Let me
      think. I can't take your money without making a return for it. Let me
      think.&rdquo; He tottered to the door, opened it, and passed out into the hall.
      There Nelson heard him striding back and forth for several minutes.
      Presently he came back. He was walking more erectly. There was in his eyes
      a flitting gleam of hope. Approaching, he laid a quivering hand on
      Nelson's shoulder. &ldquo;I have thought of a plan,&rdquo; he said, almost eagerly.
      &ldquo;Your partner in business, Mr.&mdash;Mr. Mayhew, came down here looking
      for you, and he told me how my unpleasant disclosure had unstrung you,
      upset your prospects, and caused you to leave home. Now, see here. It has
      just occurred to me that I am actually the only living individual who
      knows the&mdash;the true facts about your birth and your father's life.
      Now here is what I can and will do&mdash;you see, what <i>I</i> say, what
      <i>I</i> testify to during my lifetime will stand always. I am willing to
      take that&mdash;that money, if you will let me give you sworn papers,
      showing that it was all a mistake, and that your parents were actually man
      and wife. This could harm no one, and it would be only justice to you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson stood up suddenly. It was as if a great light had suddenly burst
      over him. His blood bounded through his veins.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You will do that?&rdquo; he cried&mdash;&ldquo;to?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, and not a living soul could ever contradict it,&rdquo; the old man said,
      eagerly. &ldquo;I can put into your hands indisputable proof. More than that,
      I'll write up to Mayhew and Duncan in your neighborhood and show the
      matter in a thoroughly new light.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two men met. For a moment there was silence in the room so
      profound that the flame of the lamp made an audible sound like the drone
      of an imprisoned insect. The old man was the first to speak.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; he asked, almost gleefully, and he rubbed his palms
      together till the dry skin emitted a low, rasping sound.
    </p>
    <p>
      Suddenly Nelson sank back into his chair and covered his face with his
      hands.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What do you say?&rdquo; repeated the old man; &ldquo;surely you won't re&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He was interrupted by Nelson, who suddenly looked up, and with a frank
      stare into the old man's face he said, calmly:
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I can't be a party to that, Mr. Floyd. I fully understand all it
      would mean to me before the world, but I am not willing to bear the stamp
      of a lie, no matter how justifiable it may seem, all through life. A man
      can enjoy being only what he really is, either high or low. No, sir, I
      appreciate your willingness to help me, but you can't do it that way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you&mdash;you can't mean to refuse!&rdquo; old Floyd gasped.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I <i>have</i> to,&rdquo; said the young man. &ldquo;As for the real dishonesty of the
      thing, I might as well be any other sort of impostor. No, I want to be
      only what I am in this world. Besides, I can't be a party to your swearing
      a lie. No, I'll have to decline.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then&mdash;then,&rdquo; the old man groaned&mdash;&ldquo;then I can't take your
      money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you'll have to,&rdquo; Nelson smiled, sadly. &ldquo;I can <i>make</i> you do it.
      I'll give you no other recourse. I shall simply instruct the bank in the
      morning to place it to your credit and charge it to my account. If you
      don't draw it out, neither you nor I will get the benefit of it, for I
      shall never touch it again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Taking his hat, Nelson moved towards the door, followed by the tottering,
      faintly protesting old man. And as he was leaving the last words the
      visitor heard were: &ldquo;I can't take it, sir. I can't take money from you, as
      bad as I need it. I can't&mdash;I can't!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      When Nelson Floyd reached the hotel it was eleven o'clock. He found Pole
      seated in the dark at an open window, his coat and shoes off. He was
      smoking.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, here you are,&rdquo; was the mountaineer's greeting. &ldquo;I was sorter
      sleepy, but I wanted to hear what you done, so I run down an' got me a
      nickel cigar. Then I've put in my time watchin' the folks in the street.
      I'll be dadblasted ef thar ain't as many night-hawks on the wing now as
      thar was jest after supper.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Nelson threw off his coat and hat and sat down and recounted briefly all
      that had taken place at Floyd's, Pole smoking thoughtfully the while. When
      Nelson ceased speaking Pole rose and began to undress.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So the blamed old codger talked like he wasn't goin' to draw the money,
      eh?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Well, that sorter upsets me; I can't exactly make it out,
      Nelson. I'll have to think that over. It ain't what I expected him to do.
      I thought he'd pounce on it like a duck on a June-bug. No, that's quar, I
      tell you&mdash;powerful quar!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They had been in bed perhaps two hours and Floyd was asleep, when
      something waked him and he lay still, listening. Then, looking through the
      darkness, he saw Pole sitting on the edge of his bed, his feet on the
      floor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It ain't no use,&rdquo; Floyd heard him muttering; &ldquo;I can't sleep&mdash;thar
      ain't no good in tryin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the reason you can't sleep?&rdquo; Floyd asked, suddenly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh!&rdquo; Pole exclaimed, &ldquo;I didn't know you was awake. I heard you breathin'
      deep an' natural jest a minute ago.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But why can't you sleep?&rdquo; Floyd repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know, Nelson,&rdquo; Pole answered, sheepishly. &ldquo;Don't you bother. Turn
      over an' git yore rest. I reckon I'm studyin' too much. Thar's nothin' on
      earth that will keep a feller awake like studyin'. I hain't closed my
      eyes. I've been lyin' here wonderin' an' wonderin' why that old cuss
      didn't want to take that money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, he simply didn't feel like accepting it from a&mdash;a stranger and
      a man he had treated coldly, and perhaps too severely, on a former
      meeting. You see, he felt unworthy&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Unworthy hell! That ain't it&mdash;you kin bet yore socks that ain't it!
      That <i>sort</i> o' man, in the hole he's in, ain't a-goin' to split hairs
      like that, when he's on the brink o' ruin an' ready to commit suicide. No,
      siree, you'll have to delve deeper into human nature than that. Looky'
      here, Nelson. I'm on to a certain thing to-night fer the fust time. Why
      didn't you tell me before this that Henry A. Floyd got his start in life
      by a plantation left him by his daddy?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I thought you knew it!&rdquo; Floyd said, sleepily. &ldquo;But what's that got
      to do with his not wanting to take the money?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know,&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;I'll have to study on it. You turn over an'
      git that nap out. Yo're a-yawnin' fit to bust that night-shirt.&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was about eight
      o'clock the next morning when Floyd waked. The first thing he saw was Pole
      seated in the window chewing tobacco. He was fully dressed, had shaved,
      and wore a new white shirt and collar that glistened like porcelain in the
      morning sun; he had on also a new black cravat which he had tied very
      clumsily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good gracious, have you been waiting for me?&rdquo; Floyd cried, as he sprang
      out of bed and looked at his watch.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Not much I hain't,&rdquo; the mountaineer smiled. &ldquo;I was up at my usual time,
      at sunrise. I struck a restaurant and got me some fried eggs an' coffee,
      an' then walked half over this dern town.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I'm sorry you've had your breakfast,&rdquo; Floyd said, &ldquo;for I wanted you
      to go down with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thankee&rdquo;&mdash;Pole shrugged his shoulders and smiled&mdash;&ldquo;I tried
      that last night in yore place, an' thar was so many niggers in burial
      suits standin' round that big room that it looked like resurrection day in
      a coon graveyard. The damned idiots stared at me as ef they thought I'd
      blowed in off'n a load o' hay. They passed me from one to t'other like
      coals o' fire on a shovel till they landed me in a corner whar nobody
      wouldn't see me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd laughed. &ldquo;You are all right, Pole; don't you ever let that fact
      escape you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you think so, Nelson? Well, anyway, a biggity nigger waiter tried to
      take me down once when I was here, about a year ago. I'd heard a good deal
      o' talk about that fine eatin'-room down the street whar only the big Ikes
      git the'r grub, an', wantin' a snack, I drapped in an' hung up my hat. The
      head coon tuck me to a table whar some other fellows was eatin', an'
      another one made me a present of a handkerchief an' shoved a card under my
      nose. The card had lots o' Dutch on it, an' I was kinder flustered, but as
      the nigger looked like he understood our language, I told 'im to never
      mind the printin' but to fetch me two fried eggs an' a cup o' coffee an'
      free bread, ef he had it, an' ef not to charge it in the bill. Well, sir,
      after I'd give the order, the coon still stood thar, tryin' his level best
      to turn up his flat nose; so I axed 'im what he was waitin' fer, an' he
      sneered an' axed me ef that was all I expected to eat. I told 'im it was,
      an', with a grin at the coon at the next table, he shuffled off. Well, you
      know, I was hot under the collar, an' I seed that the other men at the
      table looked like they was with me, though they didn't chip in. Purty soon
      my waiter come back with my order, an', with a sniff, he set it down. It
      looked like he thought jest to be a lackey in a fine house like that was
      next to wearin' wings an' flyin' over golden streets. He axed me ag'in ef
      that was all I wanted, an' when I said it was he give another sniff, an'
      drawed out a pad an' writ down twenty-five cents on it in great big
      figures, an' tore off the leaf an' drapped it in front o' my plate.
      'Mighty small bill,' he said. 'Yes,' said I, 'that order 'ud 'a' cost
      fifty cents in a <i>fust-class</i> place, but I was busy an' didn't have
      time to go any furder.' Well, sir, them men in front o' me jest hollered.
      They banged on the table with the'r knives an' plates, an' yelled till
      everybody in the room stood up to see what was the matter. One big, fat,
      jolly-faced man with a red, bushy mustache in front of me re'ched his paw
      clean across the table an' said: 'Put 'er thar, white man; damn it, put
      'er thar!' I tuck a drink with 'im when we went out. He tried to buy me a
      five-dollar hat to remember 'im by, but I wouldn't take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd laughed heartily. He had finished dressing. &ldquo;Did you finally get it
      settled in your mind, Pole, why that old man didn't want to take my check
      last night?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar's a lots o' things I've got to git settled in my mind,&rdquo; was the
      somewhat evasive reply. &ldquo;I told you I was goin' to take the ten-thirty
      train fer Darley, but I ain't a-goin' a step till I've seed a little
      furder into this business. Looky' here, Nelson Floyd, fer a man that's had
      as much dealin's with men in all sorts o' ways as you have, you are
      a-actin' quar.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't understand you.&rdquo; Floyd had put his hand on the latch to open the
      door, but, seeing his friend's serious face, he went back to the window
      wondering what Pole was driving at.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say,&rdquo; said Pole, &ldquo;that Henry A. Floyd came into his plantation at his
      daddy's death?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's my impression, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The mountaineer went to the cuspidor near the washstand and spat
      deliberately into it; then he came back wiping his lips on his long hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;An' when the old man died he jest had two sons&mdash;yore daddy an' this
      one here?&rdquo; Pole said, tentatively, his heavy brows drawn together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, that's right, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Nelson&rdquo;&mdash;the mountaineer was staring steadily at his friend&mdash;&ldquo;I
      make a rule never to judge a person too quick, but whar I see a motive fer
      evil in a man that ain't plumb straight, I generally find some'n'
      crooked.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm sure I don't understand you, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd said, his eyes wide in
      curiosity.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole stepped near to Floyd and laid his hand on his arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Do you mean to tell me, as keen and sharp as you are, that you tuck that
      old skunk's word about a matter as important as that is, when he come into
      property from yore granddaddy&mdash;property that 'ud be part yore'n as
      his brother's son? Shucks! I'm jest a mountain scrub, but I ain't as big a
      fool as that.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I know!&rdquo; said Floyd, wearily. &ldquo;I suppose you are right, but I don't
      care to go to law about a little handful of property like that; besides,
      you know it would be my interest <i>only</i> in case I was a <i>lawful</i>
      heir&mdash;don't forget that damnable fact, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm not thinkin' about the value of property, nuther,&rdquo; said Baker; &ldquo;but,
      my boy, I am lookin' fer a <i>motive</i>&mdash;a motive fer rascality, an'
      I think I've found one as big as a barn. I don't any more believe that
      dirty tale old Floyd told you than I'd believe it about my old saint of a
      mother.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you don't know what he showed me, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd sighed. &ldquo;I never had
      the heart to go over it thoroughly, but it was conclusive enough to draw a
      black curtain over my whole life.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't care, Nelson,&rdquo; Pole said, warmly. &ldquo;I don't give a damn what he
      said, or showed you. Thar's a big, rotten stench in Denmark, I'm here to
      tell you; an' ef I don't squeeze the truth out o' that old turnip before
      night I'll eat my hat. You go on an' git yore breakfast, an' let me map
      out&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      There was rap on the door. Floyd opened it. A negro porter in uniform
      stood on the threshold.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;A man down-stairs wants to see you, Mr. Floyd,&rdquo; he announced.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Did he give his name?&rdquo; Nelson asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, sir, he didn't.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's an old, white-headed, dingy-faced fellow, ain't he?&rdquo; Pole put in.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, sir,&rdquo; answered the servant. &ldquo;He looks like he's sick.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you tell 'im to come up here,&rdquo; said Pole, his face rigid, and his
      eyes gleaming triumphantly. When the negro had gone the two friends stood
      facing each other. &ldquo;Nelson, my boy,&rdquo; Pole said, tremulously, &ldquo;I'm goin' to
      stroll outside down the hall. I'd bet a full-blooded Kentucky mare to a
      five-cent ginger-cake that you can run this whole rotten business up a
      tree if you will play your cards exactly right. Looky' here, Nelson, I've
      changed my mind about goin' out o' this room. Thar's entirely too much at
      stake to leave you with the reins to hold. You are too touchy on a certain
      delicate subject&mdash;you'll take a lot o' guff rather than ask
      questions. I wish you'd go out and let me meet that man fust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll do anything you suggest, Pole,&rdquo; Floyd declared, his face twitching
      sensitively.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you skoot into that empty room next door. I seed it open when I
      come up. Let me have the old codger to myself fer jest five minutes and
      then I'll turn 'im over to you. Hurry up! I don't want 'im to see you
      here.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd acted instantly, Pole heard the door of the adjoining room close
      just as the elevator stopped at the floor they were on.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good,&rdquo; he ejaculated. He threw himself back in a chair and had just
      picked up a newspaper when old Floyd cautiously peered in at the half-open
      door.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Come in, come in, Mr. Floyd,&rdquo; Pole said, cordially. &ldquo;Early bird, ain't
      you?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;They told me Mr. Floyd was here,&rdquo; the old man said, awkwardly, as he
      stepped inside and glanced around the room. He was, in the open daylight,
      even paler and more despondent-looking than he had appeared the previous
      evening. In his hand he held Nelson's check folded and clutched tightly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's jest gone out,&rdquo; Pole said, indicating a chair, &ldquo;set down; he'll be
      back here in a minute.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I&mdash;I thought he was up here alone,&rdquo; the old man stammered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it don't make no difference,&rdquo; Pole smiled, easily, &ldquo;me'n' Nelson's
      jest like two brothers. You see, what one knows the other does. The truth
      is, me'n' him work together, Mr. Floyd, an' I've been investigatin' that
      case about his mammy an' daddy fer sometime. I run the whole thing down
      yesterday, an' come in an' told 'im about it last night after he'd got
      back from yore house. By gum! the boy broke down an' cried like a child
      fer pure joy. It would 'a' done you good to 'a' seed 'im. That was an'
      awfully nasty thing fer a proud young sperit to stand up under, an' you
      bet gittin' it off was a relief.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You mean&mdash;&rdquo; The old man sank heavily into a chair, but he could go
      no further. He stared helplessly into Pole's inscrutable face, and then
      his shifting eyes fell guiltily.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, you see,&rdquo; Pole smiled, plausibly; &ldquo;all I wanted was a clew to start
      from, an' after nosin' about whar Nelson's daddy had lived I at last
      discovered that he was part heir to that property o' yore'n, then, you
      see, the whole shootin'-match was as clear as a wart on the side of my own
      nose. The next discovery was the marriage record, an' then I had the whole
      thing in apple-pie order. You needn't set thar an' look scared out o' yore
      skin, Mr. Floyd. Nelson 'ud have his right arm sawed off at the
      shoulder-joint rather'n prosecute you. He told me last night that he'd
      stand by you. He's got money to burn, an' he'll never let his daddy's
      brother suffer. He told me jest this mornin'&mdash;'Pole,' said he, 'I
      don't believe Uncle Henry would 'a' kept this back so long ef he hadn't
      been mighty nigh out o' his head with his own troubles.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God knows I wouldn't! God knows that!&rdquo; sobbed the old man, impulsively.
      &ldquo;I meant to tell him the truth the day I met you and told you he was my
      nephew, but I had a sick spell, and I got to worrying about the little all
      I had for my old age. I thought you were prying into matters, too, and
      knew that any question about the titles would make my creditors jump on
      me, and&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I see, I see!&rdquo; said Pole. Indifference was in his voice, but his rugged
      face was afire, his great, eager eyes were illumined by a blaze of
      triumph. &ldquo;I reckon the proof you showed him was forgery, Mr. Floyd, but of
      a harmless kind that most any man in trouble naturally would&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, those letters were not forgeries,&rdquo; broke in the old man. &ldquo;They were
      really my brother's, but they related to his life with another woman. When
      their child died, she deserted him for another man. My brother came home
      broken-hearted, but he finally got over it, and married a nice girl of
      good family. She was Nelson's mother. In my great trouble, and facing
      ruin, it struck me that the letters would convince the boy and he would
      keep quiet and not put in a claim until&mdash;until I could see my way out&mdash;but
      now, you say he knows it all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, an' is so happy over it, Mr. Floyd, that instead o' givin' you
      trouble, he'll throw his arms around you. God bless you, old hoss, you've
      been denyin' the finest member yore family ever had. I reckon you can turn
      over to him sufficient proof&rdquo;&mdash;Pole drew himself up with a start&mdash;&ldquo;proof,
      I mean, that will, you see, sort o' splice in with all I've run up on&mdash;proof
      that he is legally yore nephew.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, plenty!&rdquo; the old man said, almost eagerly; &ldquo;and I'll get it up at
      once. I've brought his check back,&rdquo; he unfolded it and held it in his
      quivering hands. &ldquo;I couldn't take money from him after treating him as I
      have.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed outright. &ldquo;You keep that check, old man,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Nelson
      Floyd will cram it down yore throat ef you won't take it any other way. I
      tell you he's jest tickled to death. He thinks the world and all of you
      because you are the only kin he ever laid eyes on. Now, you stay right
      whar you are an' I'll send 'im to you. He's not fur off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Hurrying into the next room, Pole saw Floyd standing at a window looking
      out into the street, a touch of his old despondency on him. He caught
      Pole's triumphant smile and stood with lips parted in suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It's jest as I told you, my boy,&rdquo; the mountaineer said, with a chuckle.
      &ldquo;He's owned up to the whole blasted thing. You've got as good a right to
      vote in America as any man in it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Good God, Pole, you don't mean&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You go in thar an' he'll tell you all about it.&rdquo; Pole continued to smile.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say he has actually confessed of his own accord?&rdquo; Floyd cried,
      incredulously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I <i>did</i> sorter have to lead 'im along a little,&rdquo; Pole laughed.
      &ldquo;To unlock his jaws, I told 'im me 'n' you already knowed the facts, so
      you might as well take that stand, give 'im plenty o' rope an' let 'im
      tell you all about it. But don't be hard on 'im, Nelson; the pore old cuss
      wanted to do the fair thing but was pressed to the wall by circumstances
      an' devilish men.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God, Pole, thank God!&rdquo; Floyd cried. &ldquo;I can hardly believe it's
      true.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, it is, all right enough,&rdquo; Baker assured him. &ldquo;Now, I'm goin' to
      catch the ten-thirty train. I want to git home before you do, an' git this
      thing circulated&mdash;so nobody won't snub you an' feel bad about it
      afterwards. I'll strike old Mrs. Snodgrass the fust thing. She is editor
      of the <i>Hill-top Whirlwind</i>, an' will have an extra out ten minutes
      after I land containin' full particulars. Fer once I'm goin' to put her to
      a good use. She'll certainly make the rounds, an' as I don't want the old
      thing to walk 'er props off, I'll lend 'er a hoss. But I'll tell you what
      I'd like fer you to do, Nelson, an' I almost ax it as a favor.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's that, Pole?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I want you to take that old chap under yore wing to-day an' git 'im
      out o' the clutch o' them shyster lawyers that's got 'im scared to death.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You may rest assured that I'll do that,&rdquo; Floyd said, as he hurried away.
    </p>
    <p>
      A moment later, as Pole was passing Nelson's room to reach the main
      stairway, he glanced through the open door. Old Floyd sat with bowed head,
      wiping his eyes on his handkerchief, and his nephew stood by him, his hand
      resting on his shoulder.

      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HREE days later,
      towards sundown, as Pole was about to enter Floyd &amp; Mayhew's store,
      the old man came from! behind one of the counters and, with a smile of
      welcome, caught his arm and drew him to the edge of the sidewalk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I am not much of a hand to talk on any subject, Pole,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But
      there is something I've got to say to you, and it comes from the heart.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, ef it ain't a dun I'll be glad to hear it,&rdquo; Pole smiled. &ldquo;When I
      fust catched sight of you, it flashed over me that ef I didn't make
      another payment on that debt you'd have to take my farm. But I'm gettin'
      on my feet now, Mr. Mayhew, an'&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll never bother you on that score,&rdquo; the merchant said, impulsively. &ldquo;I
      was just about to tell you that I am deeply grateful for what you did for
      Nelson. Oh, he's told me all about it!&rdquo; The old man held up his hand and
      stopped Pole, who was on the point of decrying his part in the matter in
      question. &ldquo;Yes, he told me all you did, Baker, and I don't actually
      believe any other man in the whole state could have worked it so fine; and
      the boy's coming back here, Pole, has been my financial salvation. I
      couldn't have kept on here, and it would have killed me to see the old
      business fall to pieces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet, I'm glad he's back, too,&rdquo; Pole returned. &ldquo;An' he's happy over
      it, ain't he, Mr. Mayhew?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah, there's the trouble, Baker!&rdquo; the old man sighed. &ldquo;It looks like, with
      all that has come his way of late, that he would be satisfied, but he
      isn't&mdash;he simply isn't. Baker, I think I see what's lacking.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You think you do, Mr. Mayhew?&rdquo; Pole leaned forward anxiously.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I believe it's due to Nathan Porter's daughter. God knows she's the
      very girl for him. She's one woman that I admire with all my heart.
      Nelson's got sense; he sees her good qualities, and wants her, but the
      report is out that her and Hillhouse are courting down at Cartersville.
      The preacher's had two weeks' extension on his vacation, and they tell me
      he is cutting a wide swath. Folks down there are raving over his bright
      sermons, and naturally that will flatter and influence a woman's judgment.
      Besides, I really believe the average woman would rather marry a mountain
      circuit-rider on three hundred a year than a man in easy circumstances in
      any other calling.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't know as to that,&rdquo; Pole said, evasively. &ldquo;Nobody kin pick an'
      choose fer a woman. Ef I had a dozen gals I'd keep my mouth shet on the
      husband line. That's old man Dickey's policy, over at Darley; he has ten
      gals that he says has married men in every line o' business under the sun.
      The last one come to 'im an' declared she wanted to marry a tight-rope
      walker that was exhibitin' in the streets. That sorter feazed the old
      chap, and he told the gal that her husband never could rise but jest so
      high in the world an' was shore to come down sooner or later, but she was
      the doctor an' to go ahead. Even <i>that</i> marriage turned out all
      right, fer one day the chap, all in stars an' spangles an' women's
      stockin's, fell off'n of a rope forty feet from the ground. He struck a
      load o' hay an' broke his fall, but on his way down he seed the sale sign
      of a grocery across the street an' bought the business, an' now Dickey's
      gettin' his supplies at wholesale prices.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Turning from the old man, Pole passed the clerks and a few customers in
      the store and went back to Floyd's desk, where his friend sat writing.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Got yore workin' gear on I see,&rdquo; he observed, with a smile. &ldquo;You look
      busy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd pointed to a stack of account-books on the desk and smiled. &ldquo;The old
      man got these in an awful mess,&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;But I am getting them straight
      at last.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's business?&rdquo; Pole asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;In the store, pretty good,&rdquo; Floyd answered; &ldquo;but as for my own part, I'm
      busy on the outside. I closed a nice deal yesterday, Pole. You remember
      the offer I made Price for his plantation, furnished house, and everything
      else on the place?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You bet.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, he came to my terms. The property is mine at last, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Gee whiz! what a purty investment! It's a little fortune, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, it's the sort of thing I've wanted for a long time,&rdquo; Floyd returned.
      &ldquo;Most men have their hobbies, and mine has always been to possess a model
      farm that I could keep up to the highest notch of perfection for my own
      pleasure and as an inspiration to my neighbors.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Bully, bully place, Nelson! You'll always be proud of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;There's only one drawback,&rdquo; said Floyd; &ldquo;you see, it will never suit me
      to live there myself, and so I've got to get a sharp manager that I can
      trust.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Ah yes, you bet you have!&rdquo; Pole declared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And such a man is hard to find, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, I should think so!&rdquo; the farmer answered. &ldquo;Captain Duncan told me he
      fell behind three thousand dollars in one year all on account of his
      manager being careless while nobody was there to watch 'im.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He never paid his man enough,&rdquo; Nelson said. &ldquo;I shall not follow that
      plan. I'm going to pay my superintendent a good, stiff salary, so as to
      make it interesting to him. Pole, there is only one man alive that I'd
      trust that place to.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole stared in a bewildered way. Floyd was leading him beyond his depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say thar ain't, Nelson?&rdquo; was all he could say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;And that man is you, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Me? Good Lord, you are plumb cracked&mdash;you are a-jokin', Nelson.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I never was more serious in my life. If I can't get you to take that
      place in hand for me, I shall sell it to the first bidder. Pole, I'm
      depending on you. The salary is three thousand a year, rent of the house
      free, and all the land you want for your own use thrown in.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Three thousand! Geewhilikins,&rdquo; Pole laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'd be a purty lookin' chump drawin' that much of any man's money.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You'll draw that much of mine,&rdquo; Floyd said, looking him straight in the
      eye, &ldquo;and you will make me the best financial return for it of any man in
      the world.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's ridiculous, Nelson, you are plumb, stark crazy!&rdquo; Pole was really
      frowning in displeasure over he hardly knew what.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I'm not crazy, either,&rdquo; Floyd pursued, laying his hand on the
      farmer's shoulder. &ldquo;You've often said that I have a good head for
      business, well&mdash;that's exactly what's causing me to make you this
      proposition.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You are a liar, an' you know it!&rdquo; Pole growled. &ldquo;You know you are a-doin'
      it beca'se you want to help me'n' my family, and, by the holy smoke, I
      won't let you. Thar! I'm flat-footed on that! <i>I won't let you</i>.
      Friendship is one thing an' takin' money from a friend is some'n' else.
      It's low down, I'm here to tell you. It's low down, even ef a body is on
      the ragged edge o' poverty, fer ever' man ort to work fer hisse'f.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pole, I get out of patience with you sometimes,&rdquo; Floyd said,
      earnestly. &ldquo;Now, answer this: don't you know that if you <i>did</i> accept
      my offer that you would not let my interests suffer wilfully?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Of course I do, damn it!&rdquo; Pole retorted, almost angrily. &ldquo;Ef I was
      workin' fer you in <i>any</i> capacity I'd wear my fingers to the bone to
      do what was right by you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, there you are!&rdquo; Floyd cried, triumphantly. &ldquo;Wouldn't I be a pretty
      fool not to try to employ you, when not one man in ten thousand will be
      that conscientious? You've answered yourself, Pole. I'm going to have you
      on that job if I have to double the pay.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you won't git me, that's certain!&rdquo; Pole retorted. &ldquo;You are offerin'
      it to me fer no other reason than that we are friends, an' I'll be damned
      ef I take it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Look here, Pole Baker,&rdquo; Floyd smiled, as he left his high stool, locked
      his arm in that of his companion, and drew him to the open door in the
      rear. &ldquo;You have several times given me lectures that have done me more
      solid good than all the sermons I ever heard, and it's my time now.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;All right, shoot away!&rdquo; Pole laughed. &ldquo;The truth is, I feel derned mean
      about some o' the things I've said to you when I look back on 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, you've shown me many of my biggest faults, Pole, and I am going to
      dangle one of yours before your eyes. I've seen you, my friend, take money
      that your reason told you was needed by your wife and children, whom you
      love devotedly, and, in a sort of false pride, I've seen you spend it on
      men of the lowest order. You did it under the mistaken notion that it was
      your time to treat. In other words, you seemed possessed with the idea
      that you owed that crowd more than you did that tender, trusting little
      woman and her children.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Damn it, you needn't remind me of that, Nelson Floyd! I know that as well
      as any man alive!&rdquo; Pole's face was full, and his voice husky with
      suppressed emotion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I know you know it, Pole, and here is something else you'll have to
      admit, and that is, that you are this minute refusing something that would
      fairly fill your wife with happiness, and you are doing it under the
      damnably false notion that such deals should not be made between friends.
      Why, man, friends are the only persons who ought to have intimate business
      relations. It is only friends who can work for mutual benefit.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I can't argue with you,&rdquo; Pole said, stubbornly, and he turned
      suddenly and walked down through the store to the front. Floyd was
      watching him, and saw him pause on the edge of the sidewalk, his head
      down, as if in deep meditation. He was a pathetic-looking figure as he
      stood with the red sunset sky behind him, his face flushed, his hair
      thrown back from his massive brow.
    </p>
    <p>
      Taking his hat, Floyd went out and took him by the arm, and together they
      strolled down the street in the direction of Pole's farm. Presently Floyd
      said: &ldquo;Surely you are not going to go back on me, Pole. I want you, and I
      want you bad.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thar's one thing you reminded me of in thar at the desk,&rdquo; Pole said, in a
      low, shaky voice, &ldquo;and it is this: Nelson, the little woman I married
      hain't never had one single hour o' puore joy since the day I tuck 'er
      from her daddy's house. Lord, Lord, Nelson, ef I could&mdash;ef I <i>jest
      could</i> go home to 'er now an' tell 'er I'd got a lift in the world like
      that the joy of it 'ud mighty nigh kill 'er.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, Pole&rdquo;&mdash;Floyd suddenly drew him around till they stood face to
      face&mdash;&ldquo;<i>you do it</i>. Do you hear me? <i>You do it</i>. If you
      don't, you will be taking an unfair advantage of a helpless woman. It's
      her right, Pole. You haven't a word to say in the matter. The house will
      be vacant to-morrow. Move her in, Pole; move the little woman in and make
      her happy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The eyes of the two men met. Pole took a deep, lingering breath, then he
      held out his hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'll go you, Nelson,&rdquo; he said; &ldquo;and ef I don't make that investment pay,
      I'll hang myself to the limb of a tree. Gee whiz! won't Sally be tickled!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      They parted; Floyd turned back towards the village, and Pole went on
      homeward with a quick, animated step. Floyd paused at the roadside and
      looked after him through the gathering dusk.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;He's happy, and so will his wife be,&rdquo; he said to himself. &ldquo;But as for me,
      that's another matter. She's going to marry Hillhouse. Great God, how
      strange that seems! Cynthia and that man living together as man and wife!&rdquo;

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">I</span>T was almost dark
      when Pole reached his humble domicile. The mountain air was cool, and
      through the front window of the living-room he saw the flare of a big,
      cheerful fire. He went into the house, but his wife was not in sight.
      Looking into the bedroom, he saw the children sound asleep, their yellow
      heads all in a row.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;God bless 'em!&rdquo; he said, fervently. &ldquo;I reckon the'r mammy's down at the
      barn.&rdquo; Going out at the back-door, he went to the cow-lot, and then he
      heard Sally's voice rising above the squealing of pigs and the cackling of
      hens. &ldquo;So, so, Lil! can't you behave?&rdquo; he heard her saying. &ldquo;I git out o'
      all patience. I can't keep the brat out. I might as well give up, an' yet
      we've <i>got</i> to have milk.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What's the matter, Sally?&rdquo; Pole called out, as he looked over the
      rail-fence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why, I can't keep this fool calf away,&rdquo; she said, turning to him, her tin
      pail in her hand, her face red with vexation. &ldquo;The little imp is stealin'
      all the milk. He's had enough already to bust 'im wide open.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole laughed merrily; there was much stored in his mind to make him
      joyous. &ldquo;Let me git at the dern little skunk,&rdquo; he said; and vaulting over
      the fence with the agility of an acrobat, he took the sleek, fawnlike
      creature in his strong arms and stood holding it against his breast as if
      it were an infant. &ldquo;That's the way to treat 'im?&rdquo; he cried. And carrying
      the animal to the fence, he dropped it on the outside. &ldquo;Thar, you scamp!&rdquo;
       he laughed; &ldquo;you mosey around out here in the tater-patch till you l'arn
      some table manners.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Sally laughed and looked at her husband proudly. &ldquo;I'm glad you come when
      you did,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;fer you wouldn't 'a' had any milk to go on yore mush;
      me'n' the childem have had our supper an' they are tucked away in bed.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Let me finish milkin',&rdquo; Pole said. &ldquo;An' you go in an' git my mush ready.&rdquo;
       He took the pail and sat down on an inverted soap-box. &ldquo;I'll make up fer
      that calf's stealin' or I'll have old Lil's bag as flabby as an empty
      meal-sack.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few minutes he followed Sally into the kitchen where she had his
      simple supper ready for him. When he had eaten it, he led her into the
      living-room and they sat down before the fire. It was only for a moment,
      though, for she heard little Billy talking in his sleep and sprang up and
      went to him. She came back to her chair in a moment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The very fust spare money I git,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;I'm goin' to have panes o'
      glass put in that window in thar. I keep old rags stuffed in the holes,
      but the rain beats 'em down, and hard winds blow 'em out. It don't take as
      much fire-wood to keep a tight house warm as it does an open one like
      this.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Sally, we ought to live in a great big fine house,&rdquo; he said, his eyes on
      the coals under the red logs.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I say!&rdquo; she sneered. &ldquo;I've been afeard some'n' mought happen to drive us
      out o' this 'un. Pole, to tell the truth, I've been worryin'.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You say you have, Sally?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I worry all day, an' sometimes I wake up in the night an' lie unable
      to sleep fer thinkin'. I'm bothered about the debt you owe Floyd &amp;
      Mayhew. It's drawin' interest an' climbin' higher an' higher. I know well
      enough that Nelson wouldn't push us, but, Pole, ef he was to happen to
      die, his business would have to be settled up, an' they say Mr. Mayhew
      hain't one speck o' mercy on pore folks. When it was reported that some'n'
      had happened to Nelson a while back, I was mighty nigh out o' my head with
      worry, but I didn't tell you. Pole, we've got to git free o' that debt by
      some hook or crook.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I think we kin manage it,&rdquo; Pole said, his eyes kindling with a subtle
      glow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's the way you always talk,&rdquo; Mrs. Baker sighed; &ldquo;but that isn't
      payin' us out.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;It comes easy to some folks to make money,&rdquo; Pole said, with seeming
      irrelevance; &ldquo;an' hard to others. Sally, did you ever&mdash;have you ever
      been on Colonel Price's plantation?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Many and many a time, Pole,&rdquo; Mrs. Baker answered, with a reminiscent glow
      in her face. &ldquo;When I was a girl, he used to let our crowd have picnics at
      his big spring, just below the house, and one rainy day he invited some of
      us all through it. It was the only time I was ever in as fine a house as
      that an' it tuck my breath away. Me'n' Lillie Turnbull slipped into the
      big parlor by ourselves and set down an' made out like we lived thar an'
      was entertainin' company. She'd rock back an' forth in one o' the big
      chairs an' pretend she was a fine lady. She was a great mimic, an' she'd
      call out like thar was servants all around, an' order 'em to fetch 'er
      cool water an' fan 'er an' the like. Poor Lillie! the last I heard of her
      she was beggin' bread fer her childern over at Gainesville whar Ned was
      killed in an' explosion at the cotton-mill whar he'd finally got work.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I jest started to tell you,&rdquo; Pole said, &ldquo;that Nelson Floyd bought that
      plantation to-day&mdash;bought it lock, stock, an' barrel&mdash;house,
      furniture, hosses, implements&mdash;everythin'!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You don't say!&rdquo; Mrs. Baker leaned forward, her eyes wide in surprise.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, he tuck it in out o' the wet with part o' the money he made on that
      Atlanta deal. An' do you know, Sally, I was right thar in the back end o'
      his store an' heard 'im contract with a man to manage it fer 'im. The
      feller is to git three thousand dollars a year in cash&mdash;two hundred
      an' fifty dollars a month, mind you, an' also the use of the big furnished
      house, an' as much land fer himself as he needed, the use of the buggies
      an' carriage an' spring-wagon an' barn&mdash;in fact, the whole blamed
      lay-out. He axed me about hirin' the feller an' I told 'im the dem skunk
      wasn't wuth his salt, but Nelson would have his way. He engaged 'im on the
      spot.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Who was the man, Pole?&rdquo; there was just a shade of heart-sick envy in the
      tired countenance of the woman.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, it was a feller that come up from Atlanta about three days ago,&rdquo; Pole
      answered, with his usual readiness. &ldquo;It seems that him an' Nelson was
      sorter friends, an' had had dealin's in one way an' another before.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Has this&mdash;this new man any wife?&rdquo; Mrs. Baker inquired, as a further
      evidence of secret reflections.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes&mdash;a fine woman, and nice childem, Sally. He seemed to be the only
      scrub in the bunch.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Mrs. Baker sighed. &ldquo;I guess he's got some'n' in 'im,&rdquo; she said, her eyes
      cast down, &ldquo;or Nelson Floyd, with his eye for business, wouldn't 'a' give
      'im a mansion like that to live in an' all them wages. He must be an
      educated man, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No he ain't,&rdquo; Pole smiled; &ldquo;he barely kin read an' write an' figure a
      little; that's all. Sally, the feller's a-settin' right here in this room
      now. I'm the manager o' that big place, Sally.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She laughed as if to humor him, and then she raised her eyes to his.
      &ldquo;Pole,&rdquo; she said, in a cold, hard voice, &ldquo;don't joke about a thing like
      that. Somehow I don't believe that men who joke about doin' well, as es ef
      the like was clean out o' the'r reach, ever do make money; it's them that
      say what one kin do another kin that make the'r way.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I wasn't jokin', little woman.&rdquo; Pole caught her hand and pressed it.
      &ldquo;As God is my judge, I'm the man, an' you' an' me an' the childern are
      a-goin' to move into that fine house right off.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      For a moment she stared into his face incredulously, and then gradually
      the truth dawned upon her.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Pole,&rdquo; she cried. &ldquo;I can't stand it&mdash;it will <i>kill</i> me!&rdquo;
       and with a great sob the little woman burst into tears. He tried to stop
      her, his rough hand on her frail, thin back, but her emotion swept through
      her like a storm. Suddenly she raised a wet, glowing face to his, and,
      with her sun-browned hand pressed tightly on her breast, she cried: &ldquo;It
      hurts; it hurts right here&mdash;oh, Pole, I'm afraid it will kill me!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      In a few moments she was calmer, and as she sat in the red fire-light all
      aglow with her new happiness, she was a revelation to him. Not for years
      had he seen her look that way. She seemed young again. The marks of
      sorrow, poverty, and carking fear had dropped from her. Her eyes had the
      glisten of bedewed youth, her voice the vibrant ring of unquenchable joy.
      Suddenly she stood up.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What you goin' to do?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;To wake the childern an' tell 'em,&rdquo; she said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I don't believe I would, Sally,&rdquo; he protested.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I am&mdash;I <i>am!</i>&rdquo; she insisted. &ldquo;Do you reckon I'm goin' to
      let them pore little things lie thar an' not know it&mdash;not know it
      till mornin'?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      He let her have her way, and walked out on the little porch and slowly
      down to the barn. Suddenly he stretched out his hands and held them up
      towards the stars, and took a deep, reverent breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I wish I'd l'arnt to pray when I was a boy,&rdquo; he said, lowering his arms.
      &ldquo;Somehow I feel like I've at last come through. I've come from the shadow
      of the Valley of Death out into God's eternal light. Then I'd like to put
      in a word at the Throne fer Nelson. Ef I knowed how to say it, I'd beg the
      Almighty to turn Hillhouse down. Hillhouse kin git 'im another one, but
      Nelson never kin&mdash;never in this world! He hain't got that look in the
      eyes. He's got a case o' woman as bad as I have, an' that's sayin' a
      lots.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole turned and slowly retraced his steps. Going in and sitting down by
      the fire again, he heard his wife's voice rising and falling in a sweet
      monotone. After a while she ceased speaking and came back to the fire.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;So you had to wake 'em,&rdquo; he said, tenderly, very tenderly, as if his soul
      had melted into words.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tried, Pole, but I couldn't,&rdquo; she made answer. &ldquo;I shuck 'em an' shuck
      'em. I even tuck little Billy up an' rolled 'im over an' over, but he was
      too dead tired to wake. So I give up.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I heard you talkin',&rdquo; Pole said, wonderingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, I had to talk to somebody, Pole, an'&mdash;well, I was a-tellin'
      'em. They was asleep, but I was a-tellin' 'em.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She sat down by him. &ldquo;I ain't a-goin' to close my eyes to-night,&rdquo; she went
      on, softly; &ldquo;but what does it matter? I reckon thar won't be no sleepin'
      in heaven, an' that's whar I am right now, Pole.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She put the side of her flushed face down on his knee and looked into the
      fire.

    <p class="pfirst">
      <span class="dropcap" style="font-size: 4.00em">T</span>HE following
      evening about eight o'clock Floyd walked over to Baker's house. He found
      his friend seated alone before a big fire of red logs. &ldquo;Hello! Come in,
      Nelson,&rdquo; Pole called out, cordially, as he saw the young man through the
      open door-way. &ldquo;Come in an' set down.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The young merchant entered and took a vacant chair.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;How's your wife, Pole?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Huh, crazy, crazy&mdash;crazy as a bed-bug!&rdquo; Baker laughed. &ldquo;You'd think
      so ef you could see 'er. She spent all the evenin' at yore plantation, an'
      come home beamin' all over with what she's seed an' her plans.&rdquo; The farmer
      jerked his thumb over his shoulder towards the kitchen. &ldquo;She's in thar
      packin' up scraps now. She knows we can't leave till day after to-morrow,
      but she says she wants to be doin' some'n' towards it, even ef she has to
      pack an' unpack an' pack again. My boy, she's the happiest creature God
      ever&mdash;I mean that <i>you</i> ever made, dern you. She has yore name
      on 'er tongue every minute in the day. You know she's always said she had
      as many childem as she wanted&rdquo;&mdash;Pole laughed impulsively&mdash;&ldquo;but
      she says now she'd go through it all ag'in ef she knowed it 'ud be a boy
      so she could call it after you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I certainly would take it as a great honor,&rdquo; Floyd said. &ldquo;Your
      children are going to make great men, Pole. They show it in their heads
      and faces.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I hope so, Nelson.&rdquo; Pole suddenly bent his head to listen. &ldquo;That's
      Sally talkin' now,&rdquo; he said, with a knowing smile. &ldquo;She sometimes talks
      about all this to 'erse'f, she's so full of it, but she ain't talkin' to
      'erse'f now. You kin bet yore bottom dollar she ain't, Nelson. I say she
      ain't an' I mean it, my boy.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Some one's in there, then?&rdquo; said Floyd.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole looked steadily into the fire, not a muscle of his face changed.
      &ldquo;Somebody come back from Cartersville this mornin',&rdquo; he said,
      significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floyd's heart gave a big jump. &ldquo;So I heard,&rdquo; he said, under his breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, she's in thar now. She'd heard we was goin' to move an' come over
      jest after supper. She was plumb happy to see Sally so tickled. I didn't
      mean to eave'drop, but I went in the entry jest now to hang up my bridle
      an' couldn't help it. It was so purty, I could 'a' listened all day&mdash;Sally
      puttin' on, an' tellin' 'er she'd send the carriage over fer 'er to spend
      the day, an' that Cynthia must be shore an' send in 'er cyard at the door
      so thar 'ud be no mistake, an' so on.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd made no response. He was studying Pole's face, digging into it with
      his eyes for something he felt lay just beneath the unruffled surface.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Then I heard some'n' else,&rdquo; Pole said; &ldquo;an' I'm goin' to feel mean about
      totin' it to you, beca'se women has a right to the'r secrets, an' who they
      pick an' choose fer the'r life-mates ort to be a sacred matter, but this
      is a thing I think you have a right to be onto.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;What is that, Pole?&rdquo; Floyd seemed to be holding his breath. He was almost
      pale in his great suspense.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why I heard Cynthia deny up an' down flatfooted that she was engaged to
      Hillhouse. Lord, you ort to 'a' heard her snort when Sally told 'er it had
      been the general belief about here ever since her an' him went off to
      Cartersville. She was good mad. I know that fer I heard Sally tryin' to
      pacify 'er. I heard Cynthia say all of a sudden: 'My mother put that
      report into circulation. I know it now, and she had no right to do it.'&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd breathed more freely, a gleam of hope was in his eyes, his face was
      flushed. He said nothing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Pole suddenly drew his feet back from the fire. &ldquo;Don't you want a drink o'
      fresh water, Nelson?&rdquo; he asked.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, thank you,&rdquo; Floyd said.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Well, I do. Keep yore seat. Since I left off whiskey I'm a great
      water-drinker.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Pole had been gone only a minute when Floyd heard light steps in the entry
      leading to the kitchen. He sprang up, for Cynthia stood in the door-way.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Why&mdash;why,&rdquo; she stammered, &ldquo;Mr. Baker told me some one wanted to see
      me. I&mdash;I had no idea that you&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I want to see you bad enough, God knows, Cynthia,&rdquo; Floyd found himself
      saying, &ldquo;but I did not tell him so. That, you know, would not be
      respecting the message you sent me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The message?&rdquo; she said. &ldquo;I'm sure I don't understand you.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the message you sent me by your mother,&rdquo; Floyd explained.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But I didn't send you any message,&rdquo; Cynthia said, still mystified, as she
      stared frankly into his eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I mean the&mdash;the night I came for you,&rdquo; Floyd pursued, &ldquo;the night I
      was so presumptuous as to think you'd run away with me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, did she&mdash;did my mother tell you&mdash;&rdquo; Cynthia was beginning to
      understand. &ldquo;Did she say that I&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;She told me you said you wanted me never to bother you again.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The girl lowered her head, the fire lighted up her face as she stood, her
      eyes on the rough floor. She was silent a moment as if in deep thought,
      then she looked into his eyes again. &ldquo;I begin to see it all now,&rdquo; she
      said. &ldquo;I wondered why you&mdash;how you could have treated me that way
      after&mdash;after all you'd said.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Cynthia, what do you mean? Do, <i>do</i> tell me!&rdquo; He leaned closer to
      her&mdash;she could feel his quick, excited breath. &ldquo;Surely you could not
      believe I'd have left if you hadn't wished it. Oh, little girl, I have
      been the most miserable man alive over losing you. I know I am unworthy of
      you&mdash;I always shall be that&mdash;but losing you has nearly killed
      me. Your mother told me that awful night that you not only wanted me to
      let you alone, but that you were going to marry Hillhouse.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia gave him a full, frank glance. &ldquo;Nelson,&rdquo; she said, &ldquo;my mother made
      up most of what she told you that night. I did promise not to run away
      with you&mdash;she made me do that. You have no idea what she resorted to.
      She determined to thwart us. She made me believe her mind was wrong and
      that she would kill herself if I left.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;But you went to her yourself, dear,&rdquo; Floyd said, still in the dark, &ldquo;and
      told her of our plans.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;No, I didn't, Nelson. She overheard our talk the week before. She
      followed me out to the grape-arbor and heard every word of it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I see&mdash;I see!&rdquo; exclaimed Floyd; &ldquo;she was at the bottom of it
      all.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Yes, her mind was frightfully upset. She came to me this morning and
      cried and told me that she had heard so many nice things about you of late
      that she was afraid she had wronged you. She thinks now that her mind was
      really unbalanced that night. I believe it myself, for no thoroughly sane
      person could have played the part she did. She persuaded herself that your
      intentions were not pure and she felt justified in taking any step to save
      me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, I remember now,&rdquo; said Floyd. &ldquo;She could easily have misunderstood my
      meaning that night, for I was in such a state of nervous excitement that I
      did not go into details as to my plans. After I left you I remembered,
      too, that I had not offered you a beautiful ring that I'd bought for you
      in Atlanta. It's in my trunk in my room. Even after I'd lost all hope of
      ever winning you, I could not bear to part with it.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, Nelson, did you get me a ring?&rdquo; She leaned towards him in childlike
      eagerness. &ldquo;What kind of one was it?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;The prettiest, whitest diamond I could buy in Atlanta,&rdquo; Floyd said,
      almost holding his breath in suspense. &ldquo;Oh, Cynthia, you say your mother
      kept you from meeting me that night. If you had come what would have been
      your decision?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia's color rose; she avoided his hungry eyes as she looked down into
      the fire. The house was very still, and Pole Baker's voice suddenly rose
      into audibility.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I tell you, I've jest <i>got</i> to have a kiss,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;and I'm goin'
      to have it right this minute! Do you reckon I'm goin' to stand here idle
      an' them two in thar&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Pole, Pole, stop! Let me alone&mdash;behave yore-se'f!&rdquo; cried Mrs. Baker.
      There was a shuffling of feet then all was quiet.
    </p>
    <p>
      Floyd leaned towards Cynthia till his lips almost touched her pink ear.
      &ldquo;If you had met me that night what would have been my fate?&rdquo; he asked,
      tremblingly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Cynthia hesitated a moment longer, then she looked straight into his eyes
      and said, simply: &ldquo;I was ready to go with you, Nelson. I'd thought it all
      over. I knew&mdash;I knew I'd be unhappy without you. Yes, I was ready to
      go.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Thank God!&rdquo; Floyd cried, taking her hands and holding them tenderly. &ldquo;And
      Hillhouse, you are not engaged to him, then?&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh no. He was very persistent at Cartersville, but I refused him there
      for the last time. There is a rich old maid in the town who is dead in
      love with him and admires his preaching extravagantly. He showed me his
      worst side when I gave him his final answer. He told me she had money and
      would marry him and that he was going to propose to her. Do you think I
      could have lived with a creature like that, after&mdash;after&mdash;&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      She went no further. Floyd drew her into his arms. Her head rested on his
      shoulder, his eyes feasting on her beautiful flushed face.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After what?&rdquo; he said. &ldquo;Say it, darling&mdash;say it!&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;After knowing you,&rdquo; she said, turning her face so that he could not see
      her eyes. &ldquo;Nelson, I knew all along that you would grow to be the good,
      strong man you have become.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;You made me all I am,&rdquo; he said, caressingly. &ldquo;You and Pole Baker.
      Darling, let's go tell him.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      Floyd walked home with Cynthia half an hour later and left her at the
      door. She went into her mother's room, and, finding the old woman awake,
      she told her of the engagement.
    </p>
    <p>
      There was no light in the room save that of the moonbeams falling through
      the windows. Mrs. Porter sat up in her bed. For a moment she was silent,
      and Cynthia wondered what she would say.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I'm glad, very glad,&rdquo; Mrs. Porter said, huskily. &ldquo;I was afraid I'd ruined
      all your chances. I see my mistake now. I misjudged him. Cynthia, I reckon
      my mind was really upset. I took a wrong view of the whole thing, and now&rdquo;&mdash;the
      old woman's voice broke&mdash;&ldquo;and now I suppose you and he will always
      hate me.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;Oh, mother, don't talk that way!&rdquo; Cynthia sat down on the bed, put her
      arm about her mother, and kissed her. &ldquo;After all, it was for the best. I
      didn't want to marry that way&mdash;this will be so much more
      satisfactory.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;That's certainly true,&rdquo; said Mrs. Porter, slightly mollified. &ldquo;I was
      wrong, but, in the long run, it is better as it is.&rdquo;
     </p>
    <p>
      The next morning after breakfast Mrs. Porter told Nathan the news as he
      stood out under an apple-tree sharpening a wooden tooth for his big
      triangular harrow.
    </p>
    <p>
      &ldquo;I knowed she'd yank 'im,&rdquo; he chuckled. &ldquo;He certainly was the king-fish o'
      these matrimonial waters, an' with all the fishin'-poles along the bank,
      it jest tuck Nathan Porter's clear-headed daughter to jerk the hook into
      his gills. But you mighty nigh spiled it with yore everlastin' suspicions
      an' the long-legged galoot that you kept danglin' 'fore the'r eyes.&rdquo;
     </p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &ldquo;Defects,&rdquo; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
